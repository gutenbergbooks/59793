<h2>Report of the Committee of Publication.</h2>

<p class="noindent"><i>Hon. H. H. Sibley, President of the Minnesota Historical Society</i>:</p>

<p>Your Committee of Publication, acting under instruction of the Executive
Council, beg leave to lay before you the accompanying annual.</p>

<p>The limited means of the Society have compelled brevity; and most of
the articles selected are of local, rather than of general interest.</p>

<p>The article on the “Mineral Regions of Minnesota” may be a matter of
some general interest; but its chief interest will be with the people of our
State.</p>

<p>The “Life of Constantine Beltrami” will be interesting to all readers;
though his connection with Minnesota and the North-west will cause it to
be read with peculiar interest by our own people.</p>

<p>The article on the “Dakota Superstitions,” coming from one most thoroughly
acquainted with those children of the forest, must awaken the interest
of all who care to enter into the study of the aboriginal character.</p>

<p>The brief sketch of the “History of the United States Land Office” contains
facts well worth preserving.</p>

<p>The article on the “Geography of Perrot,” notwithstanding the world-wide
reputation of Perrot, is rather of local, than of any general interest.
Your committee would express their regret that the want of French type
has compelled them to print the original in such style as to do great injustice
to the author. They would fain have omitted the French, and printed
only the translation, but for the earnest wish of Mr. Hill, that the fidelity
of his translation might be apparent by comparison with the original.</p>

</div>

<p>Several works on the Sioux massacre of 1862, have been added
by gift and purchase, and twenty-two volumes of Doddsley’s Annual
Register, (comprising the whole set with the exception of two volumes,)
a journal of the times from 1751 to 1780, published in London,
have been purchased and placed in our library.</p>

<p>Gen. H. S. Sanford, U. S. Minister at Belgium, an honorary member
of the society, and Hon. A. Goodrich, Secretary of Legation at
the Belgian capital and an old member of this society, were appointed
delegates to the International Archæological Congress to have
been held at Antwerp in August last, but which was postponed in
consequence of the prevalence of the cholera in that city. Both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
gentlemen signified their acceptance, presented their credentials and
agreed to represent this society at the adjourned meeting of the Congress
which is to be held during this year.</p>

<p>The society in May last caused two of the mounds on Dayton’s
Bluff to be opened. The work was superintended by Mr. W. H.
Kelley, who made an able and elaborate report to the society, which
proved the mounds to be of very great antiquity. It is contemplated
to continue the work of excavation still farther, and it is hoped that
discoveries may be made which may throw additional light on the
“Mound Builders,”—a race whose history is shrouded in the deepest
mystery and oblivion.</p>

<p>A vast deal may be accomplished for the furtherance of the objects
of the society, which will otherwise remain undone, by standing
committees who should be appointed by the council from its
members.</p>

<p>Biographies, narratives and reminiscences of the early missionaries,
fur-traders, voyageurs, government agents, explorers and old
settlers, might now, with organized and well directed effort, be easily
obtained (while the opportunities for such work are rapidly diminishing,)
and would be of incalculable interest to the future historian
and antiquary.</p>

<p>Although much has been written on the subject of the Indian
tribes who have lived within the limits of the state, yet it is a fruitful
field that is by no means exhausted.</p>

<p>Much remains to be done in the department of geology and mineralogy,
in collecting specimens and properly classifying and arranging
them.</p>

<p>The Natural History Department might become an interesting
feature of the society if we had the means to enable us to employ a
suitable person to procure and prepare specimens of the beasts and
birds found within the borders of our state. This will soon become
a labor attended with great difficulty and expense as the advance of
settlements and the exterminating policy of the hunter and trapper
will speedily cause many of the fur-bearing animals and rarer varieties
of birds to disappear.</p>

<p>A very fine collection of the birds of Minnesota was not long since
taken east and sold, which would have been secured for our society
but for the lack of means.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Our sphere of usefulness is circumscribed by our poverty. If the
legislature could be induced to increase the annual appropriation, we
might publish our “Collections” annually, as we have an accumulation
of interesting matter in manuscript, which we desire to put in
more enduring and available form, and we are continually receiving
favors from sister societies which we would be glad to reciprocate.
We would like also to bind some of the newspapers which have been accumulating
on our hands, to purchase books for the library, and to
extend historical research into departments yet unfathomed.</p>

<p>All of which is respectfully submitted,</p>

<h2 id="MINERAL_REGIONS_OF_LAKE_SUPERIOR">MINERAL REGIONS OF LAKE SUPERIOR,<br />
<span class="smaller">AS KNOWN</span><br />
FROM THEIR FIRST DISCOVERY TO 1865.</h2>

<p class="author">BY HON. H. M. RICE, OF SAINT PAUL.</p>

<p>One hundred and twenty-one years ago there were found, north Lake of
Superior, several “large lumps of the finest virgin copper.” The finder
wrote: “In the honest exultation of my heart at so important a discovery,
I directly showed it to the Company, (Hudson’s Bay Company) but the
thanks I met with may be easily judged from the system of their conduct.
The fact, without any inquiry into the reality of it, was treated as a chimerical
illusion, and a stop arbitrarily put to all farther search into the
matter, by the absolute lords of the soil.”</p>

<p>The first attempt made to obtain copper from the Lake Superior region
was by a company of adventurers from England, soon after the conquest
of Canada, “but the distracted state of affairs in America obliged them to
relinquish their scheme.” The next effort was made in 1771, by a company
who petitioned for, and obtained, a charter from the British Government.
The partners, in England, were His Royal Highness the Duke of Gloucester,
Mr. Secretary Townsend, Sir Samuel Tutchet, Baronet; Mr. Baxter,
Consul of the Empress of Russia, and Mr. Cruickshank; in America,
Sir William Johnson, Baronet, Mr. Bostwick, Mr. Baxter and Alexander
Henry.</p>

<p>“In 1770 (says Henry,) Mr. Baxter, who had sailed for England, returned,
bringing with him papers by which, with Mr. Bostwick and himself,
I was constituted a joint agent and partner, in, and for, a company of
adventurers for working the mines of Lake Superior. We passed the winter
together at the Sault de Sainte Marie, and built a barge, fit for the navigation
of the lake; at the same time laying the keel of a sloop of forty tons.
Early in May, 1771, the lake becoming navigable, we departed from
Point aux Pius, our ship yard, at which there is a safe harbour, and of
which the distance from the Sault is three leagues. We sailed for the Island
of Yellow Sands, promising ourselves to make our fortunes, in defiance
of its serpents.” After coasting about for five days, they returned to
Point aux Pius, where they erected an air-furnace. The assayer made a
report on the ores which had been collected, stating that the lead ore contained
silver in the proportion of forty ounces to a ton, “but the copper
ore, only in very small proportions indeed.” Facts developed by recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
explorations go far to show, that the day is not far distant when the silver
mines of Lake Superior will rank among the most prolific in the world.</p>

<p>Soon after testing the ores at Point aux Pius, the expedition coasted
westward for the mouth of the Ontouagon river. Henry says: “Proposing
to ourselves to make a trial on the hill, till we were better able to go
to work upon the solid rock, we built a house, and sent to the Sault de
Sainte Marie for provisions. At the spot pitched upon for the commencement
of our preparations, a green-colored water which tinged iron of a
copper color, issued from the hill, and this the miners called a leader.
Having arranged everything for the miners during the winter, we returned
to the Sault. Early in the spring of 1772, we sent a boat load of provisions;
but it came back on the 20th day of June, bringing with it, to our
surprise, the whole establishment of miners. They reported, that in the
course of the winter, they had penetrated forty feet into the hill; but, that
on the arrival of the thaw, the clay on which, on account of its stiffness,
they relied, and neglected to secure it by supporters, had fallen in;—that
to recommence their search would be attended with much labor and cost;—that
from the detached masses of metal which, to the last, had daily presented
themselves, they supposed there might be, ultimately, reached some
body of the same, but could form no conjecture of its distance.” They
concluded that the work would require more men than could be fed, and
their operations in that quarter ended.</p>

<p>A little over eighty-two years ago, the independence of the United States
was acknowledged by Great Britain, in a treaty concluded at Paris, in
which the boundaries were agreed upon. By reference to that instrument,
it will be observed that the northern line, after striking the River St. Lawrence,
follows up that stream to the great lakes, thence through the middle
of the same, and their connecting rivers, to Lake Superior; thence through
Lake Superior, <i>northward</i> of the Isles Royal and Philippean, to the Long
Lake, now known as Pigeon River; thus securing to what is now Minnesota,
about one hundred and fifty miles of the north shore of that inland
sea, and believed to contain the richest copper and silver deposits known
in the world. Benjamin Franklin was one of the commissioners to the
treaty. It is supposed that he obtained information in France of the richness
of that region; and, to his great foresight, we are mostly indebted for
that valuable acquisition. In fact, he wrote that the time would come
when the American people would consider the part he took in securing
that vast mineral region to them as one of the greatest acts of his life.
Seventy-five years after the death of that great and good man, the people
of Minnesota are about to realize the importance of the vast interests
secured by that far-seeing statesman.</p>

<p>On the 5th day of August, 1826, Lewis Cass and Thomas L. McKenney,
commissioners on the part of the United States, made and concluded a
treaty with the Chippewa Indians at Fond du Lac, Lake Superior, by which
the Chippewas granted to the United States the right to search for, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
carry away, any metals or minerals from any part of their country. No
efforts under this grant were ever made; but from that period (and even
before,) explorations, from time to time, were made by individuals; and
many indications of rich mines, (now within the limits of Minnesota,)
were discovered. Licenses to trade with the Indians were obtained,—buildings
for the ostensible purpose of trade were erected, and possession maintained
for many years, in hopes the Government would extinguish the
Indian title to the land, so that individual titles might be acquired. Time
and expense caused the abandonment of most of these points, and a consequent
dissipation of the bright visions raised by the knowledge of the
wealth which was beyond the reach of the discoverers.</p>

<p>Under the old permit system, many locations, three miles square, were
made on Lake Superior;—several on and near the Montreal river—some
on Bad River, south of La Pointe—three on the main land, opposite La
Pointe—two or three were made near Superior City, on the Nemadji, or
Left Hand river, and one settler’s claim about twenty miles north of Superior.
Several locations were made in the valley of the St. Croix river;
explorations, to a limited extent, and recent developments, give great hopes
that the Falls of the St. Croix may, at no distant day, compete with some
of the towns of Lake Superior in the shipment of copper. Two of the
mines south of Superior are being worked, both giving assurances that
success will amply reward those engaged in the work. Last year, a New
York company was formed for the purpose of working one of the locations
on Bad River. The work was commenced, and has been vigorously
prosecuted with flattering prospects. On the 30th of September, 1854, the
Chippewa Indians, by a treaty made at La Pointe, ceded all their lands on
the north shore of Lake Superior to the United States; thus removing all
obstructions to the development of the rich mines within the limits of
Minnesota. In the same year, an association was formed by gentlemen
residing in this state and Ohio for the purpose of securing a title to several
well known locations within the country ceded, which purpose they accomplished
some four or five years afterwards. The association was known
under the name of R. B. Carlton &amp; Co. On the 28th day of September,
1858, a meeting of the persons composing the association was held in the
city of Cleveland, Ohio, and, among others, the following actions were
taken:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><span class="smcap">Whereas</span>, on the 25th day of September, 1854, a portion of the undersigned entered into an

</div>

<p>Hon. Henry B. Payne, of Cleveland, was appointed President, and Jas.
Wade, jr., Secretary. Certificates of stock were issued. The next meeting
of the stockholders was called by the trustees, and held at Bayfield,
Wisconsin, July 27, 1863, which meeting adjourned to Du Luth, Minnesota,
where it convened, July 31, 1863; and on the 3d of the next month, August,
on motion of B. F. Paine, it was unanimously resolved, that they proceed
to organize two companies under the laws of Minnesota. Hon. Geo.
L. Becker presented drafts of articles of associations for a corporation to
be known as the North Shore Mining Company; and, also, another corporation
to be known as the French River Mining Company, which were
approved, acknowledged by the corporators, and ordered to be placed on
record as required by law. The capital stock in each company was $100,000,
divided in 2,000 shares of $50 each. The first meeting of the corporators
and stockholders of each of said new companies was held in Cleveland,
Ohio, November 2, 1863, at which meeting the “French River Mining
Company” and the “North Shore Mining Company” were organized
by the election of boards of five directors each—three, residents of Ohio, one
of the city of New York, and one of the State of Minnesota. The directors
organized by appointing Hon. Henry B. Payne, president, and James
Wade, jr., secretary and treasurer. The trustees of the Carlton &amp; Co.
association conveyed to the “French River Mining Company” the south-west<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
quarter, and lots Nos. 3 and 4 of section No. 17, in town 51 north of
range 12, west, in Saint Louis county, Minnesota, containing 165 16-100
acres. The trustees conveyed to the “North Shore Mining Company” the
south-east quarter of section 25, town 52, range 12, west, in same county.
During the year 1864, a shaft was sunk, by the North Shore Company, to
the depth of 20 feet, and by French River Company, 40 feet—both giving
indications of valuable results.</p>

<p>At a meeting of the stockholders, held on the 6th of July, 1864, Gen. A.
S. Sanford, of Cleveland, was chosen president, in place of H. B. Payne,
resigned, but who still remains as one of the directors. The French River
Company sent up men, tools, and supplies sufficient to prosecute the work,
day and night, during the winter. The work is in charge of Frank Salisbury,
who is sinking a shaft one hundred and fifty feet from the old one,
with the intention of drifting from one to the other. I have, perhaps,
gone too much into detail; but if the anticipations of those who have given
this subject much attention shall be realized, the silent operations and
large expenditures that have been made, will, hereafter, render any facts,
connected with the first developments of the mineral wealth of Minnesota,
interesting in the future. But a few years ago, those engaged in developing
the copper mines on Lake Superior, within the state of Michigan,
were looked upon as visionary speculators. The completion of the Sault
St. Mary canal gave such facilities as enabled them to draw capital from
all parts of the United States and to convince the most skeptical that the
basin of that vast inland sea contained untold wealth. Of the many mines
in successful operation, a single one—the Quincy, yielded, the past season,
3,102,532 pounds, or 1,551 tons, 532 pounds of copper, worth one million
five hundred thousand dollars. When we have communication by railroad
to the head of lake navigation, the most skeptical cannot over rate the
mineral wealth that will be developed, nor the commercial advantages
that will inure to the state—enriching and infusing new life into every
city, town and hamlet.</p>

<h2 id="CONSTANTINE_BELTRAMI">CONSTANTINE BELTRAMI.</h2>

<p class="author">[By A. J. Hill, of St. Paul; at the request of the Minnesota Historical Society.]</p>

<h3>§ 1. INTRODUCTORY.</h3>

<p>Though narratives of the fortunes of early explorers of a country cannot,
in general, throw any light upon its history, apart from their travels
in the region itself, yet such recitals or biographies may still be useful in
enabling us to form juster opinions of the accounts given by the travelers
of their discoveries, from the knowledge afforded as to character, attainments
and position.</p>

<p>Of the subject of this article, till within a few years, nothing was known
to us, Minnesotians, beyond the little to be gleaned from his own books of
travel and from the narrative of the expedition of Major Long; and even
these works are so out of date that the name of Beltrami is unfamiliar to
our ears. His life is like the bridge in the vision of Mirza—we see but the
middle of it—the beginning and end are hid in obscurity. The recent publication,
in Italy, of biographical notices of this traveler, has furnished
the means of supplying the deficiency of information concerning him; and
at the request of the Historical Society of Minnesota, the present memoir
has been compiled, as a fitting contribution to its “Collections.”</p>

<h3>§ 2. PUBLISHED KNOWLEDGE OF BELTRAMI BEFORE HIS DEATH.</h3>

<p>No doubt, at the time our traveler visited the United States, more or less
was said concerning him in the journals of the day; and that he was violently
assailed by writers of that time is shown in his own books; but
such accounts, appearing in fleeting papers, are now entirely inaccessible,
and indeed would be of but little interest or value if they could be found.</p>

<p>Hitherto, therefore, our knowledge of Beltrami was derived from three
books only, which were:</p>

<p>1. A work, published by himself at New Orleans in 1824, entitled “La
Decouverte des Sources du Mississippi et de la Riviere Sanglante,” one vol.,
8vo pp. 328. 2. “Keating’s Narrative of Long’s Expedition to the Sources
of the St. Peter’s River, &amp;c.,” Philadelphia, 1824; and 3. “A Pilgrimage
in Europe and America, leading to the Discovery of the Sources of the
Mississippi and Bloody River, with a description of the whole course of
the former, and of the Ohio. By J. C. Beltrami, Esq., formerly judge of a
royal court in the ex-kingdom of Italy.” London, 1828; 2 volumes. 8vo.,
pp. 1093.</p>

<p>The first of these is a narrative simply of his tour in the west, from
Pittsburg to the head waters of the Mississippi, and thence to New Orleans,
written in French, and in the form of letters addressed to a friend,
the Countess <i>Compagnoni</i> born <i>Passeri</i>. Major Long’s book contains but
one or two references to Beltrami, and those of a depreciating character.
The exact nature of the disagreement between the two gentlemen is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
known, nor would it be right to exhume and display it, if it could be done.
All familiar with the history of “expeditions” must have noticed how often
coolness or rupture have occurred between leading men of such parties,
arising from arrogance, jealousy, or incompatibility of temper. The “Pilgrimage”
of Beltrami gives an account of his European travels previous
to his coming to the United States, and then embodies his former work
which he seems merely to have translated into English, without other
alterations than a few verbal changes.</p>

<p>A synopsis of the personal history found in the above works is as
follows:</p>

<p>He had been an official of the ex-kingdom of Italy, and was sent into
exile without trial—traveled in France, Germany, and England, in 1821-2—went
to the United States in 1823, and descended the Ohio river to its
mouth; thence, in company with Major Taliaferro, embarked for the Upper
Mississippi—reached Fort St. Anthony (Snelling) May 20, 1823,
whence he had expected to accompany Major T. up the river St Peter—at
that time unexplored—with the intention of proceeding further, toward
the sources of the Mississippi, also unknown. But circumstances did not
admit of that, and he was on the point of changing his direction for the
south, by traversing by land, the wild tracts lying between the Fort and
Council Bluffs, when Major Long and his party unexpectedly arrived.
He accompanied this expedition, which left the Fort on the 7th of July, as
far as Pembina, where he quitted it, on the 9th of August, and with a <i>bois
brule</i> and the two Chippewas only, for companions, plunged into the wilderness
lying to the south east, and struck “Robber’s” (Thief) river near
its confluence with Red Lake River (which he calls “Bloody River,” and
insists that it is the true Red River.) He then followed the course of the
latter stream to Red Lake, whence, after visiting its south shore, he ascended
the river of the Grand Portage to its sources at a small lake on a hill
where he arrived on the 28th, and which, on “the theory of the ancient
geographers, that the sources of a river which are most in a right line
with its mouth, should be considered as its principal sources, and particularly
when they issue from a Cardinal point and flow to the one directly
opposite,” he maintained to be the head of the Red River of the North.
This lake he also described as supplying the most northern sources of the
Mississippi; and on that ground, and also that they had been previously unknown,
rested his claims as a geographical discoverer. He named the lake
“Julia,” from a dear friend of his, deceased, [Moroni says, “after the
woman of his heart;”] and the stream issuing southwardly from it, the
“Julian sources of the Mississippi.” The present Itasca Lake he referred
to as called by the Indians “Bitch Lake,” (Lac la Biche—“Elk” Lake,) and
as being most probably the “western sources of the Mississippi<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>.” After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
ascending Leech Lake River, and visiting the lake itself, he returned by
the Mississippi to the Fort, (Fort Snelling) arriving there the 30th of September,
and thence descended to New Orleans, where, in the spring of
1824, he published the French account of his travels.</p>

<p>He now disappears from our view.</p>

<h3>§ 3. BIOGRAPHICAL FACTS FROM RECENT ITALIAN SOURCES.</h3>

<p>Gabriele Rosa, of Bergamo, Lombardy, an author of note, furnished to
the <i>Review</i> of Venice, (Revista Veneta) a couple of papers on this traveler,
which appeared April 20 and 27, 1856, and were reprinted, at Bergamo,
in 1861, under the title, “Of the Life and Writings of Constantine Beltrami
of Bergamo, Discoverer of the Sources of the Mississippi;” (Della vita e
degli scritti di Costantino Beltrami da Bergamo, scopritore delle fonti del
Mississippi)—a pamphlet of 34 pages octavo. On being applied to, through
the post, the author courteously sent several copies of his little work to
the United States—to the writer of this paper—besides furnishing, in his
letters, information in reply to inquiries.</p>

<p>In consequence of this correspondence, which took place in 1863-4, the
municipality of the same city formed the plan of publishing, and dedicating
to the Historical Society of Minnesota, a work which should be a proper
memorial of him who was their countryman and so deserving of honor.
This book was brought out in the beginning of 1865 and is entitled “Costantino
Beltrami da Bergamo—Notizie e lettere pubblicate per cura del
municipio di Bergamo e dedicate alla societa storica di Minnesota.” It is
a small but handsome quarto of 134 pages and contains: 1. As a frontispiece,
a photograph from the full length portrait of Beltrami, painted by
Professor Enrico Scuri, and presented to the public. 2. An elegant dedicatory
preface, addressed to the Society, and signed by the members of the
city council. 3. The papers of Signore Rosa, before mentioned. 4. A
lecture on the same subject as the preceding, delivered by Count Pietro
Moroni, in 1856, before the Athenæum of Bergamo, and 5. Letters from
Chateaubriand and other eminent men, addressed to him, also one from
his own pen.</p>

<p>From these sources, our knowledge of Beltrami has been perfected, and
the facts so obtained are now given—mostly in the form of a close translation.</p>

<p>J. C. Beltrami (Giacomo Costantino B.) was born at Bergamo, in 1779,
his parents being Giambattista Beltrami of that city, and Catterina Carozzi
of Pontita. His father was a man of fine presence, and of note from
his position as custom-house officer of the Venetian republic, and also by
reason of his courteous manners. There were ten children, of whom our
hero, Constantine, was the youngest. It appears that there was a tradition
in the family of its being derived from <i>Beltrand des Goths</i>, who fled from
Paris at the time of St. Bartholomew in 1572, and took refuge at Bergamo
under the sheltering wing of the Venetian republic—model in those times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
of political and religions toleration. Constantine was bred to the law;
and although he possessed a restless spirit, desirous of adventure, and that
when he was just ten years old the great public commotions that afterwards
shook all Europe were beginning, yet his natural talent prompted
him to the acquisition of the Latin and Greek literature, to which afterwards,
from his experience in public affairs, was added a rich store of geographical
knowledge, and, finally, a familiarity with the modern languages.
The courage and adventurous will that shone in him at forty-four impelled
him, in his youthful vigor, to abandon the paternal house for military
affairs; and being brought to the notice of men high in office, friends of
the family, and shortly opening the way by his own abilities, he became
vice-inspector of the armies; but, disgusted with occupations so far below
his higher aspirations, he returned to civil pursuits. At the age of twenty-eight,
in 1807, he became chancellor of the French departments of the
Stura and the Tanaro, and soon after judge of the court at Udine. There,
by his fine intellect and untiring zeal, he gained the praises of his superiors
who testified to him their high satisfaction, as appears by many of their
letters. Such expressions of approval were confirmed by his appointment
as judge of the civil and criminal court of Macerata. In 1812, being afflicted
with a severe disease, and having received permission, he left his post
for a time, and visited Florence, where he formed relations with the Duke
of Monteleone, and with the Countess of Albany—the friend of Alfieri
and Foscolo—who afterwards, in time of danger, protected him by her
counsels and influence. For the extraordinary activity shown by him in
certain important matters the supreme judge, minister of justice, in a letter
addressed to him in 1813, praised his zeal and acquirements, prophesying
his promotion to the chair of the president of the court of Forli, for
which the prince viceroy had proposed him for the imperial sanction of
France. However, the cloud that shortly rose and darkened the political
horizon of the Empire, and of the Italian kingdom, hindered any further
transmission of names. From Florence he was hurriedly recalled by Poerio—at
that time minister extraordinary of the King of the Two Sicilies,
for the southern Italian departments. When the Austrians occupied the
Marches, he retired to his estates at Filotrano, not far from Macerata,
whence, from 1816 to 1819, he made excursions to Naples, Rome, and Florence.
It appears that in some way he became involved in carbonarism;
for in 1821, although sick, and hardly able to stand upon his feet, he had
to leave the Romagna and go into exile.</p>

<p>Immediately after his travels in the region of the Upper Mississippi, he
embarked at New Orleans, in 1824, for Mexico, and traversed that country
from ocean to ocean. He returned from the United States to London in
1826 or 1827. The revolution of July called him to Paris, where we soon
find him in amicable epistolary relations with the Count D’Apony, the
Austrian embassador, to whom, in a letter written on the 10th of August,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
1830, a few days after the revolution, he offered his services towards ameliorating
the condition of his native country. At the same time, he carried
on a correspondence with Benjamin Constant, with Lafayette and Lafitte.
He participated in the theories of the Napoleonists of his time, and
aspired for the elevation of the nations, and especially for that of Italy.
In 1834, the Scientific Congress at Stuttgard being in session, Beltrami was
sent to it to represent the Historical Institute of France, accredited therefore
by the perpetual secretary, Mons. de Monglave, who did not hesitate
to style him one of the most honorable and distinguished of that scientific
association. Shortly after, he went to Heidelberg, where he acquired a
small landed estate which he lived on for two years. In 1837 we find him
at Vienna; then, shortly, at Home, and so—now here, now there—he lived
till 1850, when, finding himself bowed down by the weight of years, he
returned to his property at Filotrano, where, amongst his early friends, he
placidly passed the remainder of life, and where, in February, 1855, he
died, having completed his seventy-fifth year.</p>

<p>Beltrami was a man of frank and sincere soul—an enemy of all flattery,
and capable of unparalleled self denial. In proof of the latter, it is related
that although he suspected that the cases of articles sent by him from
America had been opened and plundered on their arrival at Florence, yet,
to avoid the bitterness of certainty of such fact, he would never consent to
their being examined during his lifetime, desiring that it should only be
done by his heirs,—as so happened.</p>

<p>In the desire to be more generally read, he wrote everything in foreign
languages, for which indeed he can hardly be blamed, having to print his
works out of Italy. A complete list of his published writings is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>1. <i>Deux mots sur des promenades de Paris et Liverpool.</i> Philad’a., 1823.</p>

<p>2. <i>La Decouverte des Sources du Mississippi, &amp;c.</i> New Orleans, 1824.
(Previously mentioned).</p>

<p>3. <i>A Pilgrimage in Europe and America, &amp;c.</i> London, 1828. (Previously
mentioned).</p>

<p>4. <i>Le Mexique.</i> 2 vols. 8vo. Paris, 1830.</p>

<p>5. <i>L’Italie et L’Europe.</i> Paris, 1834.</p>

<p>6. <i>Letter to the Secretary of the Historical Institute of France</i>, (in
French). Heidelberg, 1836. (Reprinted in the Bergamo city memorial).</p>

</div>

<p>The Indian curiosities and other articles brought by Beltrami to his native
country from the region of our present Minnesota, together with his
MS. papers &amp;c., were presented by his heir, a nephew, shortly after his
death, to the library of Bergamo, the municipality of which city caused
them to be properly displayed in the vestibule of the building. Signore
Rosa, his chief eulogist, says, in a private letter, that there is no genuine
portrait of him extant;—the one by Professor Scuri being drawn from
the engraving in the “Pilgrimage,” and from tradition.</p>

<h3>§ 4. REMINISCENCES OF MAJOR TALIAFERRO.</h3>

<p>Major Lawrence Taliaferro, of Beaufort, Penn., a soldier of 1812, who
from the year 1819 to 1840, acted as Agent for Indian Affairs for the tribes
of the north-west, and who yet lives in the memories of the Sioux, to whom
he was known as <i>Mahza Bakah</i> or Iron Cutter, furnished, under date of
the 4th of April, 1866, the following information concerning his friend
Beltrami:</p>

<p>“I was in Washington in 1823 relative to my official connection with the
north-western tribes of Minnesota; whilst on my return, in March, to my
post, I found a note, or card, at a hotel in Pittsburg, from Beltrami, asking
permission to bear me company to the Falls of St. Anthony. When I saw
him, his presence and manner at once obtained my confidence, and leave
was granted to do so. We passed together down the Ohio, and up the
Mississippi to Fort Snelling. I divided my quarters with him; and Col.
Snelling and lady invited him to take his meals at their hospitable table.</p>

<p>“Beltrami was six feet high, of commanding appearance and some forty-five
years of age; proud of bearing, and quick of temper, high spirited,
but always the gentleman. He expressed an earnest wish to explore the
sources of the Mississippi. I gave him a passport to go where he pleased,
and instructed the Chippewas of Otter Tail, and other lakes, to see him
safely through their country, should he seek assistance. Shortly after this
desire, Major Long, of the Topographical Engineers, with his corps, arrived.
Beltrami was introduced to Major L. and permission granted Mr.
B. to accompany the party to Pembina. At Pembina, a difficulty occurred
between Major Long and Beltrami, when the latter sold his horse (my
horse) and equipments, and in company with a half breed, passed near
the line of 49° to the sources of the Mississippi. His sufferings were of no
agreeable nature. Here, near Leech Lake, he fell in with a sub-chief, the
‘Cloudy Weather,’ most fortunately, who knew Mr. B., having seen him
in one of my councils at the agency. This old man was given, by signs,
to know that white man wanted to descend the river. The chief took our
Italian friend in his canoe, and turned down stream. Indians are proverbially
slow, hunting and fishing on the way; Beltrami lost all patience,—abused
his Indian crew,—made many menaces, &amp;c. The ‘Cloud’
tapped him on the hat with his pipe stem, as much as to say, ‘I will take
you to my father safe if you will be still.’ The old chief told of this temper
of my friend, but Mr. B. never made allusion to it, but was very grateful
to his kind Pillager friends.</p>

<p>“Beltrami had been in the military service;—was judge of a court. I
touched him at times with the appellation of Count; ‘Who is your dear
Countess to whom you address many affectionate letters?’—‘Not my wife,’
said he; ‘but a lovely woman; and if you would replace the G in your
name, [Tagliaferro] and come with me to Italy—the home of your ancestors—I
would make you happy in her company.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>“That the tour of Mr. B. was not altogether abortive, I have full reason
to believe. He explained by his notes to me his whole route, put the discovery
of the true sources correctly, as others have since done,—including
the distinguished Nicollet. To learn the habits of the Indian tribes was
almost a mania with him. He had every facility;—his greatest anxiety
was, before he left Italy, as he stated to me, to explore the wildest portion
of the continent, north and west,—to see as many of the noble North American
Indians as possible. He seemed fond of adventure. I saw he was
dispirited for the lack of means;—he did not deny it when questioned delicately
on this point.</p>

<p>“In conversing of Italy and Italian affairs, he hesitated not to speak very
broadly about the highest ecclesiastical dignitary, touching whom he often
lost his patience. Beltrami was a patriot, and undoubtedly of note, and
had suffered persecution.”</p>

<h3>§ 5. CONCLUSION.</h3>

<p>No further direct information concerning Beltrami, personally, can be
added to the preceding; and enough undoubtedly has been said to fill the
blank hitherto existing, and to place him properly before the people of
Minnesota, to the majority of whom his name is totally unknown. There
remains, however, to supplement this monograph, one more task to be
performed, at some future time, when the territory he independently explored
shall have been surveyed and mapped by the deputies of the General
Land Office, and that is the examination and verification of the route
traveled by him, and of the lakes and rivers he visited, in order to restore
and bring into popular use, so far as practicable, the names he gave to
many places; though he named only certain lakes, streams and islands,
hitherto undistinguished.</p>

<p>The Legislature, last winter, at the instance of the Historical Society,
and in conformity with the custom of naming some of the counties of a
territory or state after its early explorers, established a county by the name
of Beltrami; which extends from the first “range line” below the mouth
of Turtle River, on the east, to the line between ranges 38 and 39 on the
west, and from the line between townships 154 and 155 on the north to the
north line of Beecher county, and to the Mississippi on the south. This
county comprehends the region of the head of “Bloody River,” &amp;c., and
is in area about 4,000 square miles—subject to reduction and modification
of boundary it is true; but, it is to be hoped, always to retain the same
name, and to include the “Julian Sources of the Mississippi” within its
limits. Of this act of legislation, his friend, Major Taliaferro says, “It is
a high compliment;—one well deserved, and creditable to the movers and
State;” and all lovers of justice who read Beltrami’s own words will rejoice
that his claims have at last been officially recognized.</p>

<p>In reference to the opportunity he had of perpetuating his own name in
the Indian territory by giving it an archipelago, as he terms it, of the Mississippi—the
present “Thousand Islands,” situated a mile or two below<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
St. Cloud—he wrote, “After my death, men will dispose of my name as
God will of my soul, according as I shall have well or ill deserved during
my life; and I leave to my friends, and to those who have had opportunities
of becoming acquainted with my heart, the charge of defending my
memory, should it ever be attacked by injustice or prejudice.”</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.<br />
<span class="smaller">HYDROGRAPHY OF THE SOURCES OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.</span></h3>

<p>In reference to the question as to which stream we should look to for
the right source of the Mississippi, the following article has been prepared
by Col. Charles Whittlesey—a man well known to the reading public, not
only by his explorations and contributions to the stock of knowledge concerning
the geology and physical geography of the North West, but by
his writings on the earthworks and other relics of the aboriginal inhabitants
of the same region:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right">“<span class="smcap">Cleveland, O.</span>, March 28, 1866.</p>

<p>“Turtle Lake, at the head of Turtle River, which discharges into Cass
Lake, is the most northerly of the waters of the Mississippi. Mr. Schoolcraft
claims that Itasca Lake and its tributaries constitute the true source
of the Great River, because these streams are further from the mouth than
any other. Whether this, if true, is a correct mode of fixing the head
waters of rivers, I must be allowed to doubt. It seems to me that the
<i>largest</i> branch forms the river, and the heads of that branch constitute the
sources.</p>

<p>“When I was on the upper waters of the Mississippi, in September 1848,
I compared the quantity of water flowing from Lake Winnibigoshish with
that from Leech Lake, as far as observations without gauging enabled me
to do it. At that time I judged the discharge from the Leech Lake branch
to be three times as much as from Lake Winnibigoshish, and one of our
voyageurs, who was raised in the region, said it generally discharged twice
as much. The distance from the junction of the Leech Lake branch, below
Winnibigoshish, to the most distant sources of the various branches,
does not appear to me to be materially different. Among the hundreds
of small streams converging into, and passing through nearly as many
lakes, there cannot be said to be a main or separate river above this junction.
From this point, the Mississippi assumes its proper characteristics,
as one stream, to the gulf of Mexico; but above it, the branches are excessively
numerous. Below the junction, it is two chains wide, with a
broad regular current, having the same imposing features which it retains
to its mouth. The furthest streams that discharge into Leech Lake rise to
the south, interlocking with the waters of Pine River; but, if we can rely
upon our maps—of a region as yet unsurveyed—the development of these
branches, including the lakes through which they pass, equals in length
the Itasca branch.</p>

<p>“Our missionaries at Cass Lake said the Turtle River discharged more
water than Bemidji River, which enters Cass Lake from Itasca Lake.”</p>

<h2 id="HISTORICAL_NOTES">HISTORICAL NOTES OF THE UNITED STATES LAND OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="author">[By Hon. H. M. Rice, of St. Paul.]</p>

<p>On the 26th day of January, 1796, when the American Congress was in
session in Philadelphia, a Bill was reported for establishing land offices for
the sale of lands in the North-western Territory. It was under discussion
until April of the same year in the House of Representatives. A great
diversity of opinion existed; some were in favor of selling in small tracts
of fifty acres—others contended that none should be surveyed or sold in
less than township tracts. Some favored a Bill that would retain the lands
for actual settlers, others were for disposing of as much of the public domain
as possible, and at the highest price, for the purpose of paying the
public debt. For a long time, they could not agree upon the price. Mr.
Williams, of New York, said “it was as necessary that the country should
be settled as that the land should be sold. Or shall it be said that the honest,
industrious settlers shall make roads, bridges, and other improvements,
whilst the rich holders keep their lands in hand until these improvements
are made, in order to increase the value of them?” Mr. Williams, undoubtedly,
took a correct view of the case. The Bill, as finally agreed upon,
established the office of Surveyor General, under the following title: “<i>An
Act providing for the sale of the Lands of the United States, in the Territory
North-west of the river Ohio, and above the mouth of Kentucky river</i>.” On
the 18th of May, 1796, the Bill was approved by receiving the signature of
George Washington. The office was first opened at Marietta, Ohio, under
Rufus Putnam, Surveyor General. In 1804 it was removed to Vincennes;—in
1805 to Cincinnati;—in 1814 to Chillicothe;—in 1829 it was removed
back to Cincinnati, where it remained until 1845, when it was removed to
Detroit. In May, 1857, the office was again, and for the last time, removed
to St. Paul. It now has in its custody the original correspondence for its
establishment in 1796, which, undoubtedly, contains many important facts
and reminiscences that would not only fully pay for their perusal, but
might furnish historical points of great value. Through it, the past and
present are connected. There can be found the workings under the original
act under which no lands could be surveyed in tracts of less than 640
acres, nor sold for less than two dollars per acre; and out of this has grown
our admirable system, which places within the reach of every man a home,
be he rich, or be he poor.</p>

<p class="author">[Prepared by A. J. Hill, of St. Paul, and accepted for publication by the Minnesota Historical
Society.]</p>

<h3>§ 1. SHORT ACCOUNT OF PERROT AND HIS WRITINGS.</h3>

<p>Nicolas Perrot, whose name is already well known to the readers
of the early history of Minnesota, was born in 1644, and repaired,
at an early age, to New France, where he resided, almost habitually,
from 1665 to 1689, amongst the diverse races of its most distant
part—the extremity of the angle formed by the valleys of the St.
Lawrence and of the Mississippi. “At first simple <i>coureur du bois</i>
by trade (1665-1684), and interpreter incidentally (1671-1701), he
was at last, under the successive governments of M. M. de la Barre,
Denonville and Frontenac (1684-1699), charged with a command
analogous to that of our chiefs of Arab bureaux in Algeria.” In his
capacity of interpreter, he was present at the convocation of the
tribes at <i>Sainte-Marie-du-Sault</i>, where, on the 14th of June, 1671,
the French government assumed the sovereignty of the regions beyond
the Great Lakes. Nearly eighteen years later, on the 8th of
May, 1689, he himself, acting as principal agent, took formal possession,
in the name of the King of France, of all the country visited
by him, or that might be visited, from Green Bay to the regions beyond
the St. Croix and St. Peter. Subsequent to 1718, no information
concerning him can be obtained.</p>

<p>The writings of Perrot are as follows:</p>

<p>1. <i>Memoire sur les Outagamis, addresse au Marquis de Vaudreuil.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>Plusieurs memoires tant sur les guerres des Iroquois contre les Illinois
et les nations d’en haut, que sur les trahisons des sauvages, et en particulier,
des Outaouais et des Hurons.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>Memoire sur les moeurs, coustumes, et relligion des sauvages de
l’Amerique Septentrionale.</i></p>

<p>Of these works, the last one only, the “Memoir upon the manners,
customs and religion of the savages of Northern America,” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
must have been written some time between 1718, and 1721, has come
down to us; though the “<i>Plusieurs memoires</i>” <i>&amp;c.</i>, is supposed to have
been inserted, almost literally, by La Potherie, in the second volume
of his history. It was not composed for publication, but for the confidential
information of the Intendant of Canada, M. Begon, and remained
in manuscript till 1864, when it appeared at Leipzig and Paris,
being Part Three of the Bibliotheca Americana, edited by the Rev.
Father J. Tailhan, of the Society of Jesus, on whose authority the
preceding facts are stated. “There is only one copy of Perrot’s
memoir in existence, of the last century; the same, probably, that
Father Charlevoix used, and which he received from M. Begon, Intendant
of Canada, in 1721. Our edition is a scrupulous reproduction
of it.” [T.]</p>

<p>Scattered through this book are accounts of the Sioux and other
tribes living in the region comprised within the limits of the present
Minnesota, and between it and Lake Michigan; and, in the same
connection, a description of the country of the former nation, and other
geographical information of more or less direct reference. As an
interesting addition to our knowledge of the <i>historical geography</i> of
this region, all such notices have been carefully searched for, and are
here given in a collected form for the use of the Historical Society
of Minnesota. The extracts are purely in Perrot’s own words; no
changes having been made, even in the orthography. In addition,
though trenching somewhat on the domain of history, the episode of
the disappearance of Father Menard is included;—partly by reason
of the new and interesting version of the matter, and partly as showing
that he should be considered as one of the very earliest European
visitors to Minnesota. Our first desideratum being <i>accurate texts</i>, comments
are best postponed; yet the notes of Father Tailhan are so
well considered that this compilation would be incomplete without
the insertion of such of them as correspond to the extracts from the
original work. The translator has also ventured upon two or three
explanatory remarks, or interpolations, of his own, distinguishable
by being inclosed within brackets; except the dates, which are the
Father’s.</p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>Extracts from his “Memoire sur les moeurs, &amp;c.”</i></h3>

<p>Car le pays du nord est la terre du monde la plus ingratte, puisque, dans
quantitez d’endroits vous ne trouveriez pas un oiseau a chasser; on y ramasse
cependant des bluets dans les mois d’aout et de septembre<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Les Chiripinons ou Assiniboualas sement dans leurs marais quelques
folles avoines qu’ils recueillent, mais ils n’en peuvent faire le transport
chez eux que dans le temps de la navigation(1)....</p>

<p>Les Kiristinons qui hantent souvent le long des bords du Lac Superieur
et des grandes rivieres, ou sont plus communement les elans(2)....</p>

<p>Les sauvages que l’on nomme Saulteurs [Chippewais] sont au sud du lac
Superieur ... ils ont pour voysins et amis les Scioux, sur
les limites desquels ils chassent, quand ils veulent....</p>

<p>Si on avance dans le nord, vers l’entree d’Ouisconching, l’hiver y est extremement
froid et long. C’est la ou les castors sont les meilleurs, et le
pays ou la chasse dure plus longtemps dans l’annee....</p>

<p>Ils tirent aussy l’hyver de dessous la glace dans les marests ou il y a
beaucoup de vase et peu d’eau, une certaine racine, ... mais elle
ne se trouve que dans la Louisianne, a quinze lieues plus haut que l’entree
d’Ouisconching. Les sauvages nomme en leur langue cette racine Pokekoretch....</p>

<p>Mais les peuples plus avancez dans le nord, jusqu’a la hauteur d’Ouisconching,
n’ont plus de ces nefles, et ceux qui sont encore plus loin manquent
de ces noix semblables a celles de France....</p>

<p>Car ce pays [des sauvages des prairies] n’est que plaines; il y a seulement
quelques islets ou ils ont coustume d’aller camper pour faire secher
leurs viandes....</p>

<p>Quand touts les Outaouas se furent repandus vers les lacs [au Mechingan
(3)], les Saulteurs et les Missisakis s’enfuirent dans le nord, et puis a
Kionconan(4) faute de chasse; et les Outaouas craignants de n’estre pas
assez forts pour soustenir les incursions des Iroquois, qui estoient informez
de l’endroit ou ils avoient fait leur establissement, se refugierent au Micissypy,
qui se nomme a present la Louisianne. Ils monterent ce fleuve a
douze lieues ou environ d’Ouisconching, ou ils trouverent une autre riviere
qui se nomme des Ayoes(5). Ils la suivirent jusqu’a sa source et y recontrerent
des nations qui les receurent cordialement. Mais, dans toutte
l’etendue de pays qu’ils parcoururent, n’ayant pas veu de lieu propre a s’establir,
a cause qu’il n’y avait dutout point de bois, et qu’il ne paroissoit
que prairies et rases campagnes, quoyque les buffles et autres bestes y fusses
en abondance, ils reprirent leur mesme route pour retourner sur leurs
pas; et, apres avoir encore une fois aborde la Louisianne, ils monterent
plus haut.</p>

<p>Ils n’y furent pas longtemps sans s’ecarter pour aller d’un coste et d’autre
a la chasse: je parle d’une partie seulement de leurs gens, que les Scioux
rencontierent, prirent et ammenerent a leurs villages, ... et
puis les rendirent a leurs gens.</p>

<p>Les Outaouas et Hurons les recurent fort bien a leur tour, sans neantmoins
leur faire de grands presents. Les Scioux estant revenus chez eux avec
quelques petites choses qu’ils avoient receues des Outaouas, en firent part
aux autres villages leurs alliez, et donnèrent aux uns des haches et aux
autres quelques cousteaux ou alaines. Touts ces villages envoyerent des
deputez chez les Outaouas(6).—— ...</p>

<p>Les Scioux faisoient milles caresses aux Hurons et Outaouas partout ou
ils estoient.—— ... Les Outaouas se determinerent
enfin a choisir l’isle nommee Pelee pour s’establir; ou ils furent quelquees
annees en repos. Ils y receurent souvent la visitte des Scioux....</p>

<p>Les Hurons, ayant assez d’audace pour s’imaginer que les Scioux estoient
incapables de leur resister sans armes de fer et a feu, conspirerent avec les<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Outaouas de les entreprendre et de leur faire le guerre, afin de les chasser
de leur pays, et de se pouvoir estendre d’avantage pour chercher leur subsistance.
Les Outaouas et les Hurons se joignirent ensemble et marcherent
contre les Scioux. Ils crurent que sitost qu’ils paroistroient, ils fuiroient;
mais ils furent bien trompez; car ils soustinrent leurs efforts, et mesme les
repousserent, et s’ils ne s’estoient retirez ils auroient estez entierement
deffaits par le grand nombre de monde, qui venoient des autres villages de
leurs alliez a leur secours. On les poursuivit jusqu’a leur establissement,
ou ils furent contraints de faire un mechant fort, qui ne laissa par d’estre
capable de faire retirer les Scioux, puisqu’ils n’oserent entreprendre de
l’attaquer.</p>

<p>Les incursions continuelles que les Scioux faisoient sur eux les contraignirent
de fuir(7). Ils avoient eu connoissance d’une riviere qu’on
nomme la Riviere Noire; ils entrerent dedans et, estant arrivez la ou elle
prend sa source, les Hurons y trouverent un lieu propre pour s’y fortiffier
et y establir leur village. Les Outaouas pousserent plus loin, et marcherent
jusqu’au lac Superieur, et fixerent leur demeure a Chagouamikon.
Les Scioux, voyant leurs ennemis partis, demeurerent en repos sans les
suivre d’avantage; mais les Hurons n’en voulurent point demeurer la; ils
formerent quelques partys contre eux, qui firent peu d’effect, leur attirerent
de la part des Scioux de frequentes incursions, et les obligerent de quitter
leur fort pour aller joindre les Outaouas a Chagouamikon, avec une grande
perte de leurs gens. Aussytost qu’ils furent arrivez, ils songerent a former
un party de cent hommes pour aller contre les Scioux, et s’en vanger.</p>

<p>Il est a remarquer que le pays ou ils sont [les Sioux] n’est autre chose
que lacs et marests remplis de folles avoines, separes les uns des autres par
de petites langues de terre qui n’ont tout au plus d’un lac a l’autre que
trente a quarante pas, et d’autres cinq a six ou un peu plus. Ces lacs ou
marests contiennent cinquante lieues et d’avantage en carre, et ne sont
separes par aucune riviere que par celle de la Louisianne, qui a son lit dans
le milieu, ou une partie de leurs eaux viennent se degorger. D’autres tombent
dans la riviere de Sainte Croix, qui est situee a leur egard au nord-est,
et qui les range de pres. Enfin les autres marests et lacs situez a l’ouest de
la riviere de Saint Pierre s’y vont jetter pareillement; si bien que les Scioux
sont inaccessibles dans un pays si marecageaux, et ne peuvent y estre detruits
que par des ennemis ayant des cannots comme eux pour les poursuivre;
parceque dans ces endroits il n’y a que cinq ou six familles ensemble,
qui forment comme un gros, ou une espece de petit village, et tous les
autres sont de mesme eloignez a une certaine distance, afin d’estre a portee
de se pouvoir prester la main a la premiere alarme. Si quelqu’une de ces
petites bourgades est attaquee, l’ennemy n’en peut deffaire que tres peu,
parceque tous les voysins se trouvent assemblez tout d’un coup, et donnent
un prompt secours ou il est besoin. La methode qu’ils ont pour naviguer
dans ces sortes de lacs est de couper dedans leur semences, avec leurs cannots,
et, les portant de lac en lac ils obligent l’ennemy qui veut fuir a tourner
autour; qui vont tousjours d’un lac a un autre, jusqu’a ce qu’ils les
ayent tous passez, et qu’ils soient arrivez a la grand terre.</p>

<p>Les cent hommes Hurons s’engagerent dans le milieu de ces marests, sans
cannots, ou ils furent decouverts par quelques Scioux, qui accoururent
pour donner l’alarme par tout. Cette nation estoit nombreuse, dispersee
dans toutte la circonference des marests, ou l’on recueilloit quantite de
folles avoines, qui est le grain de cette nation, dont le goust est meilleur
que celuy du riz.</p>

<p>Plus de trois mil Scioux se rendirent de touts costez, et investirent les
Hurons, ... de tout ce party, il n’en echapa qu’un(8).</p>

<p>...</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Les Hurons, se voyant fort peu de monde, prirent le party de ne pas
songer a se venger et de vivre paisiblement a Chagouamikon pendant plusieurs
annees. Pendant tout ce temps la, ils ne furent point insultez des
Scioux, qui ne s’appliquerent uniquement qu’a faire la guerre aux Kiristinons,
aux Assiniboules et a toutes les nations du nord, qu’ils ont detruits
et desquels ils se sont aussy faits detruire respectivement....</p>

<p>Le Pere Mesnard qu’on avoit donne pour missionnaire aux Outaouas
[1660], accompagne de quelques Francois qui alloient commercer chez cette
nation, fust abandonne de touts ceux qu’il avoit avec luy, a la reserve d’un
qui luy rendit jusqu’a la mort touts les services et les secours qu’il en pouvoit
esperer. Ce Pere suivit les Outaouas au lac des Illinoets, et dans leur
fuitte dans la Louisianne jusqu’au-dessus de la Riviere Noire. Ce fut la
qu’il n’y eust qu’un seul Francois qui tint compagnie a ce missionnaire et
que tous les autres le quitterent. Ce Francois dis je suivoit attentivement
la route et faisoit son portage dans les mesmes endroits que les Outaouas;
ne s’ecartant jamais de la mesme riviere qu’eux. Il se trouva, un jour
[Aout 1661], dans un rapide qui l’entrainoit dans son cannot; le Pere pour
le soulager debarqua du sien, et ne prit pas le bon chemin pour venir a
luy; il s’engagea dans celuy qui estoit battu des animaux, et voulant retomber
dans le bon, il s’embarrassa dans un labyrinthe d’arbres et s’egara.
Ce Francois apres avoir surmonte ce rapide avec bien de la peine, attendit
ce bon Pere, et comme il ne venoit point, resolut de l’aller chercher. Il
l’appella dans les bois de touttes ses forces, pendant plusieurs jours, esperant
de le decouvrir, mais inutilement. Cependant il fit rencontre en chemin
d’un Sakis qui portoit la chaudiere du missionnaire; qui luy aprist de
ses nouvelles. Il l’asseura qu’il avoit trouve sa piste bien avant dans les
terres, mais qu’il n’avoit pas vue le Pere. Il luy dit qu’il avoit aussy trouve

mesme qu’il s’imaginoit que les Scioux l’auroient pu tuer ou qu’il en auroit
este pris. En effet, on trouva, plusieurs annees apres, chez cette nation,
son breviaire et sa soutanne, qu’ils exposoient dans les festins en y vouant
leurs mets, ... chasser du costez des Scioux,
car Chagouamikon n’en est eloigne, coupant par les terres en ligne direct,
que de cinquante a soixante lieues, ...</p>

<p>... on luy donna pour second M. de Lude [du Lhut] qu’il envoya
avertir [1684] a Kamalastigouia, au fond du lac Superieur, ou estoit son
poste(9)....</p>

<p>Je fus envoye a cette baye [des Puans, poste de Saint Francois Xavier],
charge d’une commission pour y commander en chef et dans les pays plus
eloignes du coste du ouest, et de ceux mesme que je pourrois decouvrir
[1685]....</p>

<p>Je ne fus pas plustot arrive dans les endroits ou je devois commander,
que je recus ordre de M. Denonville de revenir avec tous les Francois que
j’avois ... Je me trouvais en ce temps-la dans le
pays des Scioux ou la gelee avoit brise tous nos cannots; je fus contraint
d’y passer l’este [1686]....</p>

<p class="center">TRANSLATION.</p>

<p>For the country of the north is the most ungrateful country in the world,
since, in many places, you would not find a bird to hunt; still, blueberries
are gathered there in the months of August and September....</p>

<p>The Chiripinons, or Assiniboines, sow wild rice in their marshes, which
they afterwards gather, but they can only transport it home during the
period of navigation(1)....</p>

<p>The Kiristinons, who often frequent the shores of Lake Superior and
of the great rivers, where the elk are most commonly to be found(2)....</p>

<p>The savages, called Sauteurs, [Chippewas] are on the south of Lake
Superior....</p>

<p>They have for neighbors and friends the Sioux, upon whose limits they
hunt, when they wish....</p>

<p>Advancing to the north, towards the entry of the Wisconsin, the winter
is extremely cold and long. It is there that the beavers are the best, and
the country where hunting lasts the longest during the year....</p>

<p>They take, also, in winter, from under the ice, in marshes where there
is much mud and little water, a certain root; ... but
it is only found in <i>Louisianne</i>, fifteen leagues [4½ miles] above the entry
of the Wisconsin. The savages name this root, in their language, Pokekoretch....</p>

<p>But the tribes the furthest advanced in the north, as far as the latitude
of the Wisconsin, do not have these medlars, and those who are yet further,
want also the nuts similar to the ones of France....</p>

<p>For this country [of the savages of the prairies] is entirely plains; there
are only some islands [oases] where it is their custom to camp to dry their
meat....</p>

<p>When the Ottowas had scattered towards the lakes [to Mechingan(3)],
the Sauteurs and the Missisakis fled to the north, and then to <i>Kionconan</i>(4),
for want of hunting; and the Ottowas, fearing they were not strong
enough to resist the incursions of the Iroquois, who were informed of the
place where they had made their establishment, took refuse on the Mississippi,
called at present the <i>Louisianne</i>. They ascended this river to twelve
leagues, or about [33 miles] from the Wisconsin, where they found another
river that is called [river] of the Ioways(5). They followed it to its source,
and there met nations who received them cordially. But, in all the extent
of country which they overran, having seen no place proper to establish
themselves, by reason that there was no wood there at all, and that prairies
and level plains were all that appeared, although buffaloes and other
animals were there in abundance, they returned upon their steps by the
same route; and, after having once more reached the <i>Louisianne</i>, they ascended
higher.</p>

<p>They were not there long without scattering, going from one side to another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
for hunting: I speak of a portion, only, of their people, whom the
Sioux met and led to their villages, ... and then returned them
to the rest.</p>

<p>The Ottowas and Hurons received them very well in their turn, without,
however, making them any great presents. The Sioux having arrived at
home with some little matters that they had received from the Ottowas,
divided portions of them with the other villages, their allies, and gave to
the ones, hatchets, and to others, knives or awls. All these villages sent
deputies to the Ottowas(6)....</p>

<p>The Sioux received the Ottowas and Hurons in the best manner, wherever
they went.... The Ottowas at last resolved to
choose the island called Bald, [<i>Pelee</i>] to settle on; where they were several
years in repose. They often received there the visit of the Sioux....</p>

<p>The Hurons, having so much audacity that they imagined the Sioux
were incapable of resisting them without fire-arms and weapons of iron,
conspired with the Ottowas to make war upon them, in order to drive them
from their country, so as to be able to spread themselves more, to procure
means of subsistence. The Ottowas and the Hurons joined together and
marched against the Sioux. They believed that as soon as they would appear,
the others would fly; but they were much deceived, for their attacks
were sustained, and they were even repulsed; and if they had not retreated,
would have been entirely defeated by the great number of people who
came from the other allied villages to the assistance of the Sioux. They
were pursued to their settlement, where they were obliged to make a hasty
fort, which, however, was sufficient to cause the Sioux to retire;—not daring
to storm it.</p>

<p>The continual inroads that the Sioux made upon them constrained them
to fly(7). They had known of a river called the Black River. This they
entered; and, having arrived where it takes its source, the Hurons found
there a place fit to fortify themselves in, and to establish their village. The
Ottowas, however, pushed beyond, and reached Lake Superior, where they
fixed their home at <i>Chagouamikon</i>. The Sioux, seeing their enemies fled,
remained in peace, without following them any more. But the Hurons
were not content to stop there; they sent some parties against them, which,
however, making little impression, drew frequent incursions on the part
of the Sioux, and caused them to quit their fort to join the Ottowas at <i>Chagouamikon</i>,
with a great loss of their people. So soon as they arrived there,
they thought of forming a war party of one hundred men to go against
the Sioux, and to revenge themselves for their former defeats.</p>

<p>It is to be remarked that the country where they are [the Sioux] is nothing
but lakes and marshes, filled with wild rice, separated, the ones from
the others, by little tongues of land, which, at the most, from one lake to
the other, are but thirty to forty steps, and, in many cases, only five to six
or a little more. These lakes, or marshes, contain fifty or more leagues
square, [19 or 20,000 square miles] and are divided by no river but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<i>Louisianne</i>, which has its bed in the middle, and into which a part of their
waters is emptied. Others fall into the river of <i>Sainte Croix</i>, which is
situated, in respect to them, to the north-east, and flows near them. Finally,
the other marshes and lakes, situated to the west of the river of Saint Peter,
throw themselves similarly into it. Thus, the Sioux are inaccessible in
that marshy country, and cannot be destroyed there, but by enemies having
canoes, like themselves, to follow them; for, in these places, there are
only five or six families together, which form a hamlet, or a kind of small
village; and all the others are in the same way, at a certain distance, in
order to be ready to help each other at the first alarm. If any one of these
little villages is attacked, the enemy can hurt it but slightly; for all the
neighbors assemble at once, and give prompt assistance where it is needed.
The way they have of navigating these lakes is to strike into their [rice]
fields with their canoes, and, carrying them from lake to lake, they force
the flying enemy to turn round. Thus, they can go from one to another,
till they have passed them all, and have arrived at the main land.</p>

<p>The hundred Hurons became entangled in the middle of these marshes,
without canoes, where they were discovered by some Sioux, who hastened
to give a general alarm. This nation [the Sioux] was numerous, scattered
through all the extent of the marshes where they were gathering wild rice
which is the grain of this people, and tastes better than rice.</p>

<p>More than three thousand Sioux approached, from all sides, and invested
the Hurons, ... of all this party but one escaped(8).</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>The Hurons, seeing that they were so weak in numbers, concluded not
to seek for revenge any more, but lived peaceably at Chagouamikon for
many years. During all this time, they were not molested by the Sioux,
who only applied themselves to making war on the Kiristinons, the Assiniboines,
and all the other nations of the north, whom they have much injured,
and by whom they have, on their part, been decimated....</p>

<p>Father Menard, who had been appointed missionary to the Ottowas, [in
1660, and who went to them], accompanied by some Frenchmen that were
going to traffic with that nation, was abandoned by all who were with
him, except one, who rendered to him, to the last, all the services and assistance
that he stood in need of. The Father followed the Ottawas to the
lake of the Illinois, and in their flight to <i>Louisianne</i>, as far as to above the
Black River. There it was that this missionary had but one Frenchman
for companion, and where all the rest had left him. This Frenchman, I
say, followed carefully the route of the Ottawas, and made his portages in
the same places that they had;—never leaving the same river that they
were on. He found himself, one day [August, 1661], in a rapid that was
carrying him away in his canoe. The Father, to relieve him, disembarked
from his own, but did not take the proper road to come to him; he entered
one that had been made by animals; and desiring to return to the
right one, became embarrassed in a labyrinth of trees and was lost. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Frenchman, after having ascended the rapid, with a great deal of trouble,
waited for the good Father, and as he did not come, concluded to search
for him. He called his name in the woods with all his strength, for several
days, but in vain. However, he met, in the way, a Sauk who was
carrying the camp kettle of the missionary; and who told him news of
him. He informed him that he had found his track a long way on, in the
woods, but that he had not seen the Father himself. He told him, too,
that he had found the traces of several others going towards the Sioux.
He even said that he thought the Sioux might have killed him, or taken
him prisoner. Indeed, several years afterwards, there were found amongst
this nation his breviary and cassock, which they exposed at their ceremonies,
making offerings to them of their food....</p>

<p>... to hunt in the direction of the Sioux; for <i>Chagouamikon</i>
is only fifty to sixty leagues [138 to 166 miles] distant from them,
going across the country in a direct line....</p>

<p>... They gave him, for second. M. du Lhut, whom he
sent word to [1684] at <i>Kamalastiguoia</i>, at the further side of Lake Superior,
where was his post(9)....</p>

<p>I was sent to this bay [Green Bay, post of St. Francois Xavier], charged
with the commission to have chief command there, and in the most distant
countries on the side of the west, and even in any that I might discover
[1685]....</p>

<p>I had no sooner arrived in the places where I was to command, than I
received orders from M. Denonville to return, with all the Frenchmen that
were with me.</p>

<p>... At that time, I was in the country of the Sioux,
where the freezing [of the streams] had broken all our canoes; I was compelled
to stay there during the summer [1686]....</p>

<p>I went by land to the Miamis, who were about sixty leagues [165½ miles]
from my post [in the country of the Sioux], and returned from them the
same way that I had gone....</p>

<p>Some days after, I went across the country to the Bay [Green] with two
Frenchmen. I met, continually, with those who showed me the best road,
and treated me very well(10).</p>

<h3>§ 3. Extracts from the notes to the “Memoire sur les moeurs &amp;c.”</h3>

<p>(1) “Assinipoualaks, or <i>warriors of the rock</i>, now Assiniboines, a Sioux tribe, which, towards
the commencement of the seventeenth century, having quarrelled with the rest of the
nation, was obliged to secede, and took refuge amongst the rocks (assin) of the Lake of the
Woods.”</p>

<p>(2) “The Kilistinons lived upon the banks of Lake Alimbegong, between Lake Superior and
Hudson’s Bay.”</p>

<p>(3) “<i>Mechingan</i>—eastern Wisconsin and north-western Michigan.”</p>

<p>(4) “<i>Kionconan</i>—Kewenaw of the American maps.“ [Pronounced by the modern Chippewas
It is like <i>Ke-wa-yo-nahn-ing</i>.—E. F. Ely.]</p>

<p>(5) “The Iowas, neighbors and allies of the Sioux, dwelt between the 44th and 45th degrees
of north latitude, twelve days’ journey beyond the Mississippi: that they very likely belonged to
the latter nation, is shown by the name of <i>Nadouessioux Maskoutens</i>, or <i>Nadouessioux of the
prairies</i>, that the Algonquins had given them; for <i>Maskoute</i>, [Mush-ku-day,] the root of <i>Maskoutens</i>,
signifies <i>land destitute of trees</i>, or <i>prairie</i>.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>(6) “We know indeed that two Frenchmen visited, in 1659, the forty Sioux villages without
crossing, or even seeing, the Mississippi, of which they have only spoken from hearsay, and
from the descriptions that the Hurons of Black River gave them of it. The villages belonged,
then, all to the eastern portion of the Sioux territory, situated on this side of the river; that is
to say, in the half of the country really occupied by this nation. It may, however, be that in the
infant Mississippi, disguised, too, under a Sioux name, our two travelers did not recognize the
large and powerful river that the Hurons told them of under its Algonquin title. In this case,
they must have been, though without their knowledge, the first to see again in the seventeenth
century, the Mississippi, discovered in the sixteenth by Ferdinand de Soto.” ...
“One of these travelers was called Des Groseillers, and lived many months with the Sioux. This
we gather from the following passage of the M. S. Journal of the Jesuits of Quebec, (Aug., 1660).... “The Ottowas arrived on the 19th.... There were three hundred
of them. Des Groseillers was in their company; he had gone to them the year before....
Des Groseillers has wintered with the nation of the Ox [<i>nation du boeuf</i>], which he makes to be
4,000 men. They are the sedentary Nadouesserons’ (Sioux of the East).”</p>

<p>(7) “From the commencement of 1660, the Ottowas inhabited Chegoimegon Point [Shah-gah-wah-mik-ong—Ely],
as well as the islands adjacent to it on the southern shore of Lake
Superior. The Hurons, at that time, were in hiding near the sources of the Black River, at six
days distance (40 or 50 leagues), from the same lake, and at seven or eight from Green Bay.
The two peoples were visited, in 1659, by two French traders, who, penetrating beyond, made
alliance with the Sioux. It is then between the years 1657 [at which time the Hurons and Ottowas
were living in Mechingan,] and 1660, that the events described by Perrot must have taken
place; that is, from the flight of these tribes to the Mississippi, up to their first troubles with the
Sioux, which were followed by a new migration—that was not their last one.” ...
“In reckoning at forty or fifty leagues the six days journey that separated the residence of the
Hurons from Lake Superior, I have only applied the rule given in the <i>Relation</i> of 1658 by
Father Dreuillettes; ‘You will see also,’ he writes, ‘the new roads to go to the sea of the north,
... with the distance of the places, according to the days travel that the savages
have made, which I put at fifteen leagues a day in descending, on account of the rapidity of the
waters, and at seven or eight leagues in ascending.’” [The common league of France is equal
to 2.76 miles.]</p>

<p>(8) “This disastrous expedition following the arrival of the Hurons at Chegoimegon, it could
not, consequently, have taken place before 1662. On the other hand, it preceded, by many
years perhaps, the visit that the Chief of the Sinagaux Ottowas paid the Sioux in 1665 or 1666;
it is then very likely that the defeat of the Hurons by the Sioux occurred in one of the two years,
1662 or 1663.” ... “Two reasons have impelled me to place in 1665-1666, the arrival
of the Sioux prisoners at Chegoimegon, followed by their return to their country with the
chief of the Sinagaux and the four Frenchmen of whom Perrot speaks. The first is that, in this
year, the Sioux very certainly visited the Point of the Holy Spirit; the second, that, according
to the account of these events, as it is given by our author, four or five years at least, had passed
away between this visit and the abandoning of Chegoimegon, in 1670-71, by the Hurons and the
Ottowas.”</p>

<p>(9) “<i>Kalamalastigouia</i>—an application of DuLhut, made in 1693, in which he solicits the
concession of this post, gives the name as <i>Kamanastigouian</i>.”</p>

<p>(10) “Perrot, who was recalled in 1685, from the country of the Sioux, received, four years
later, express orders to take possession of it in the name of the king, as seen in the following
document: ...</p>

<p>“‘<i>Nicolas Perrot, commandant pour le roi au poste des Nadouesioux ...

<div class="blockquote smaller">

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Bloomington</span>, December 14, 1866.</p>

<p>Rev. <span class="smcap">John Mattocks</span>—<i>Dear Sir</i>:—I have deferred complying with your request to prepare a
paper for the Historical Society till now, only because I have never found the leisure necessary
to do it. Even now I have been obliged to let every thing else go except what was absolutely
necessary to be done in order to attend to it. The press of to-day contains a notice of your
meeting last Monday. I suppose, therefore, that I am too late, but will forward to you what I
have prepared. If it is not acceptable please return it to me.</p>

<p>The “superstitions” to which the paper relates, it may seem to some, are too absurd to be the
religion of men, however degraded, but they have been obtained from the Indians themselves,
and I have never discovered that they had anything better, but have discovered much that is
worse. I presume that no one will be disposed to say that it is my own invention, for that would
be giving me credit for more imaginative and creative genius than I ever claimed. Such as it is
I send it, and shall be satisfied if the society accepts it or returns it to me.</p>

<p>The sack I send you will find explained under the head “<i>Medicine-man a <span class="smcap">Doctor</span></i>.” It is
not the medicine sack of the medicine dancer.</p>

</div>

<p>The Dakota Indians are the tribes who are generally known by
the name of Sioux, a name given them by early French explorers.</p>

<p>Of the Dakota there are several—seven—grand divisions who are,
by their orators, sometimes spoken of as “<span class="smcap">seven fires</span>.”</p>

<p>These again were divided into a great number of smaller tribes or
clans, each having its little chief, who was simply the most influential
individual in the clan, which was composed chiefly of blood relations.</p>

<p>The chief, for generations, seems to have had but little authority
except that which he derived from the support of some medicine-man,
who attached himself to him, or from the fact that government
officers and traders transacted business with the clans through them.</p>

<p>The name Dakotah signifies much the same as confederacy. The
word is often used as the opposite of enemy.</p>

<p>These divisions and subdivisions of Indians are all embraced under
the comprehensive name <span class="smcap">Dakota</span>, the name by which they call themselves.
The Assinnaboines are said to have belonged originally to
the Dakota family.</p>

<p>A few years ago, these Dakota tribes occupied the country along
the Mississippi river, from about Prairie du Chien, to far above the
Falls of St. Anthony, the whole of the Minnesota valley, and the
immense plains extending westward to, and beyond the Missouri
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>The language of all these tribes is the same, with unimportant
dialectic differences, and seems to be entirely distinct from that of
the tribes around, except, perhaps, that of the Winnebago tribe.</p>

<p>Being one in language they are alike in their civil polity, if indeed
it can be said that they have any, alike in their religious belief
and practice, and alike in all their manners, allowing for the modifications
which have been produced by diversity of circumstances.</p>

<p>It is to the superstitions of these Dakotas that the following paper
relates.</p>

<p>In the first place it seems to be necessary to define the very significant
Dakota word <i>wakan</i>, for, in it is contained the quintessence
of their religion. It is an epitome of the whole, containing its pith
and marrow.</p>

<p>The word <i>wakan</i>, signifies anything which is incomprehensible.
The more incomprehensible the more wakan. The word is applied
to anything, and everything, that is strange or mysterious. The
general name for the gods in their dialect is this, <i>Taku-Wakan</i>, i. e.,
that which is wakan.</p>

<p>Whatever, therefore, is above the comprehension of a Dakota, is
God. Consequently, he sees gods everywhere. Not Jehovah every
where, but <i>Taku-Wakan</i>.</p>

<p>This is the starting point in their superstitions, but it is not with
ease that one can arrive at the other end of the subject. It runs
out like the division of matter, to divinity. To use an expression
of one of their own most intelligent men, “there is nothing that
they do not revere as God.” <i>Wakan</i> is the one idea of divine essence.
The chief, if not the only difference that they recognize to
exist, among all the tens of thousands of their divinities, is the unessential
one of a difference in the degree of their wakan qualities,
or in the purposes for which they are wakan.</p>

<p><i>We</i> speak of the <i>medicine</i>-man, <i>medicine</i>-feast, <i>medicine</i>-dance, and
the great-<i>spirit</i> of the Indian, while he speaks of <i>wakan</i>-man, the
<i>wakan</i>-feast, the <i>wakan</i>-dance, and the great-<i>wakan</i>.</p>

<p>Evidence is wanting to show that these people divide their <i>Taku-Wakan</i>
into classes of good or evil. They are all simply wakan.
The Dakotas have another word to represent spirit, or soul, or Jehovah,
but the word wakan is never used in that sense, though a
spirit might be wakan.</p>

<p>Evidence is also wanting to show that the Dakotas embraced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
in their religious tenets, the idea of one Supreme Existence, whose
existence is expressed by the term <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span>. If some of the
clans, at the present time, entertain this idea, it seems highly probable
that it has been imparted to them by individuals of European
extraction. No reference to such a being is to be found in their
feasts, or fasts, or sacrifices. Or if there is any such reference at
the present time, it is clear that is of recent origin and does not belong
to their system. Individuals of them may tell us that the
worship of the great medicine-dance is paid to the Great Spirit, but
it is absolutely certain that it is not, as will be seen as we proceed.</p>

<p>Mr. Carver tells us of a religious ceremony of a very singular nature—very
wakan—in which a person is carefully bound hand and foot
and mysteriously released by the gods—the performance of which he
witnessed, and which he said had reference to the <span class="smcap">Great Spirit</span>.
Doubtless it had such reference in his opinion, but it will be shown
in another place, that in fact, it had not.</p>

<p>It is indeed true, that Dakotas do sometimes appeal to the Great
Spirit when in counsel with white men, but it is because they suppose
him to be the object of the white man’s worship, or because they
themselves have embraced the Christian doctrines. Still it is generally
the <i>Interpreter</i> who makes the appeal to the Great Spirit, when
the speaker really appealed to the <i>Taku</i>-wakan, and not to the
wakan-<i>Tanku</i>.</p>

<p>Besides, the great struggle which at the present time exists between
the heathen and the Christian Dakotas, is freely <i>expressed</i>
to be a strife, between the old system of worship rendered to the
<i>Taku Wakan</i>, and the new, which is rendered to the <i>Wanku Tanku</i>.
The Christians are universally distinguished from the pagans, as being
worshippers of Wakan Tanku, or as we speak, the Great Spirit.</p>

<p>One word more by way of introduction. It is true of all the Dakota
gods, or wakans, that they are male and female, are subject to
the same laws of propagation under which men and animals exist,
and are mortal. They are not thought of as being eternal, except
it may be by succession.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<h3>DAKOTA GODS.</h3>

<h4>THE ONKTEHI.</h4>

<p>It seems to be proper to allow this wakan object to take the precedence
in our arrangement, as he does really in respectability. The
literal signification of the name is probably lost, though it may, perhaps,
signify extraordinary vital energies.</p>

<p>In their external form, the Onktehi are said to resemble the ox,
only that they are of immense proportions. This god has power to
extend his horns and tail so as to reach the skies. These are the
organs of his power. The dwelling place of the male is in the water,
and the spirit of the female animates the earth. Hence, when
the Dakota seems to be praying, chanting or offering sacrifices to the
water or to the earth, it is to this family of the gods that the worship
is rendered. They address the male as grandfather, and the female
as grandmother. Hence, also, it is probably, that the bubbling
springs of water are called the “breathing places of the wakan.”</p>

<p>Though not the same in form, and though destitute of the trident,
the horse, and the dolphin, yet, because he rules in the watery worlds
as Neptune did in the Mediterranean sea, it may not be out of
place to denominate him the Neptune of the Dakotas.</p>

<p>This god has power to issue from his body a wakan influence
which is irresistible even by the superior gods. This missive influence
is termed <i>tonwan</i>, which word will frequently recur as we proceed.
This power is common to all the Taku-Wakan. This tonwan
influence, it is claimed, is infused into each medicine-sack which is
used in the medicine dance.</p>

<p>One of these gods, it is believed, dwells under the Falls of St.
Anthony, in a den of awful dimensions, and which is constructed of
iron.</p>

<p>A little to the left of the road leading from Fort Snelling to Minnehaha,
in sight of the fort, is a hill which is used, at present, as a
burial place. This hill is known to the Dakotas as “Taku wakan
tipi,” the dwelling place of the gods. It is believed that one of this
family of divinities dwells there.</p>

<p>Not many years since, at the breaking up of the ice in the Mississippi
river, it gorged and so obstructed the channel between the falls
and Fort Snelling, that the water in a few hours rose very high.
When the channel was opened by pressure, of course, the rush of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
water “carried all before it.” A cabin which stood on the low bank
under the falls, was carried away with a soldier in it, who was never
heard of afterwards. It is universally believed by the worshippers
of the god in question, that the occurrence was caused by one of
these gods passing down the river, who took the soldier for his evening
meal, as they often feast on human spirits—<i>wicanagi</i>.</p>

<p>On the morning of July 4, 1851, at Traverse des Sioux, Robert
Hopkins, a missionary of the American board to the Dakotas was
drowned in the Minnesota river. It was the general belief and talk
among the Dakotas, who were acquainted with the facts, that this
god destroyed his life and ate his soul—nagi—because he had spoken
against his worship in the medicine-dance.</p>

<p>It is related that as some Indians were once passing through Lake
Pepin, they suddenly found themselves aground in the middle of the
lake. Their god had risen to the surface, and they were lifted from
the water on his back! Instantly they were enveloped in clouds,
and a terrific tempest arose which chilled them with fear. Eagerly
they offered their prayers and sacrifices to their venerable grandfather,
when the wakan monster began “slowly to beat his drum
the sound of which was the present thunder, while his eyes glistened
like two moons. Soon the blows fell quicker and lighter, and the
god chanted as follows:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Wakan de homni waye.</div>

<p>As the chant ceased, a calm succeeded, and one Indian with his
wife, found himself safe and tranquil on the shore, but his companions
had all perished. From that time he was a friend of this divinity,
and was honored with the name of <span class="smcap">Onktehi-duta</span>.”</p>

<p>Another chant of this god, may, with propriety, have a place here,
because it is often used in the medicine-dance, and indicates the character
of the god in the estimation of his worshippers:</p>

<p>The medicine-feast and the medicine-dance, have been received
from this god, and the chants above are much used in both.</p>

<p>The sacrifices which are required by them, are the soft down of
the swan rouged with vermilion, deer skins, tobacco, dogs, medicine-feasts
and medicine-dances.</p>

<p>Their subordinates are the serpent, lizard, frog, ghosts, owl and
eagle. These all obey their will. The Onktehi made the earth and
men, and gave the Dakotas the medicine-sack, and also prescribed
the manner in which some of those pigments must be applied, which
are daubed over the bodies of his votaries in the medicine-dance, and
on the warrior when he goes into action. They are believed to
possess a wakan and an amuletic power.</p>

<p>Among all the myriads of the Dakota gods, there are none more
respectable, or more respected, than the one above mentioned.</p>

<h4>MEDICINE DANCE.</h4>

<p>The wakan dance is represented as having been received from the
family of gods above considered.</p>

<p>The onktehi, immediately after the production of the earth and
men, to promote his own worship among them, gave to the Indians
the medicine sack, and instituted the medicine dance. He ordained
that the sack should consist of the skin of the otter, the raccoon,
the weazel, the squirrel, the loon, one variety of fish, and of serpents.
It was also ordained that the sack should contain four species
of medicines, of wakan qualities, which should represent fowls,
medicinal herbs, medicinal trees, and quadrupeds. The down of the
female swan represents the first and may be seen at the time of
the dance, inserted in the nose of the sack. Grass roots represent
the second, bark from the root of trees the third, and hair from the
back or head of a buffalo, the fourth. These are carefully preserved
in the sack.</p>

<p>From this combination proceeds a wakan influence so powerful,
that no human being, unassisted, can resist it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>At the institution of the dance, the god prepared a tent, four
square, opening towards the east, with an extended court in front,
and selecting four men for initiation, proceeded to instruct and prepare
them for the reception of the mysteries. The rules of conduct
which he gave them, were that “they should honor and revere the
medicine sack, honor all who should belong to the dance, make frequent
medicine feasts, refrain from theft, not listen to birds, (slander)
and female members should not have a plurality of husbands.” The
sum of the good promised to the faithful, was “honor from the members
of the institution, frequent invitations to the feast, abundance
of fowl, with supernatural assistance to consume it, and long life
here, with a red dish and spoon in the life to come.”</p>

<p>The evils threatened against the unfaithful were as follows: “If
unfaithful you cannot escape detection and punishment. If you
enter the forest to hide yourself the black owl is there, if you descend
into the earth serpents are there, if you flee into the air the
eagle will pursue you, and if you go into the water there I am.”</p>

<p>The candidates thus instructed and charged were placed in the
center of the tent to receive the tonwan of the sack, discharged at
them by the god himself. It is said that they perished under the
operation.</p>

<p>After consulting with his goddess, the god holding up his left
hand, and pattering on the back of it with the other, produced myriads
of little shells, whose virtue is to restore life to those who have
been slain by the tonwan of the sack. (Each of the members of the
medicine dance is thought to have one of these shells in his
body.) After taking this precaution, the god selected four other
candidates and repeated the experiment of initiation with success,
following the discharge from the sack immediately with the shell
cast into the vital parts, at the same time chanting the following
words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>Such, it is believed, was the origin of the medicine dance.</p>

<p>There are no officers, or superiority of rank, except that of age
and experience, known in this pagan institution. The dance is celebrated;
1st, on account of the death of one of its members whose
sack is given to a near relative of the deceased; 2nd, when a new
sack is to be conferred on one who desires to become a member and
who has proved himself worthy of the honor by making medicine
feasts, and rendering due honor to the members; and 3rd, in the performance
of a vow.</p>

<p>It is required of a candidate for admission, that he go through the
ceremony of the “vapor bath” once each day, four days in succession.
In the meantime some of the aged members instruct him in
the mysteries of the institution, in imitation of the course of its author
as already related. Besides, he is provided with a dish and
spoon both of wood. On the side of the dish is often carved the
head of some voracious animal, in which resides the spirit of the
<span class="smcap">Iya</span>—the god of gluttony. The dish will contain eight to ten quarts,
or more, and is always carried by its owner to the medicine feast, and
he is bound to eat all that is put in it, or pay a fine to the maker of
the feast. A woman came to the writer on one occasion to ask for
calico to make a short gown. She said she had lately had seven
new ones, but had lost them all at medicine feasts, where she was
unable to empty her dish. <span class="smcap">Grey Iron</span>, of the <i>Black Dog</i> band, used
to possess a dish on which was carved a bear entire, indicating that
he could eat as much as a bear. The candidate is also instructed in
the matter of painting his body for the dance. This paint is nearly
all the covering that he wears on the occasion. He must always
paint in the same manner for the ceremony of the dance. There is
said to be wakan virtue in this paint, and the manner of its application,
and those who have not been furnished with a better, by a war
prophet, wear it into battle.</p>

<p>The candidate being thus prepared, and having made the requisite
offerings for the benefit of the institution, on the evening of the day
which precedes the dance, is taken in charge by ten or more of the
more substantial brothers, who pass the night in devotional exercises,
such as chanting, dancing, exhorting, eating, and smoking. Early
in the morning the tent, in form like that which the god first
erected for the purposes, is thrown open for the dance. The members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
assemble painted and ornamented, each bringing his medicine-sack.</p>

<p>After a few preliminary ceremonies, appropriate to the occasion,
including a row of kettles of large dimensions, well filled and arranged
over a fire at the entrance of the court, guarded by sentries appointed
for the occasion, the candidate takes his place on a pile of
blankets which he and his friends have contributed. He is naked,
except the breech cloth and moccasins, and well smeared with pigments
of various hues. Behind him stands an aged and reliable
member. Now, the master of the ceremonies, with the joints of his
knees and hips considerably bent, advances with an unsteady, uncouth
hitching, sack in hand, wearing an aspect of desperate energy,
and uttering his “Heen, heen, heen,” with frightful emphasis, while
all around are enthusiastic demonstrations of all kinds of wild passions.
At this point the sack is raised near a painted spot on the
breast of the candidate, at which the tonwan is discharged. At the
instant the brother from behind gives him a push and he falls dead,
and is covered with blankets.</p>

<p>Now the frenzied dancers gather around, and in the midst of bewildering
and indescribable noises, chant the words uttered by the
god at the institution of the ceremony, as already recorded. Then
the master throws off the covering, and chewing a piece of the bone of
the Onktehi, spits it over him, and he begins to show signs of returning
life. Then as the master pats energetically upon the breast of the
initiated person, he, convulsed, strangling, struggling and agonizing,
heaves up the shell which falls from his mouth on a sack placed in
readiness to receive it. Life is restored and entrance is effected into
the awful mysteries. He belongs henceforth to the medicine-dance,
and has a right to enjoy the medicine feast. Now comes the
season of joy. The novice takes the wakan shell in his hand, and
in the midst of savage demonstrations of the wildest kind, exhibits
it to all the members, and to the wondering by-standers who throng
the enclosure outside. The dance continues interspersed with
“shooting each other,” rests, smoking, eating and drinking, till they
have jumped to the music of four sets of singers.</p>

<p>The following chants, which are used in this dance, will sufficiently
evince its character and tendency, and the character of its members,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
especially when it is considered that this is the <span class="smcap">religion of immortal
beings</span>—men and women.</p>

<p>The celebration of the medicine-dance, is the extraordinary part
of a system of Dakota superstition, of which the medicine-feast is
the ordinary and every day part. A very large portion of the
adults belong to this fraternity.</p>

<h4>THE WAKINYAN.</h4>

<p>This name signifies “<i>flyer</i>,” from <i>kinyan</i>, to fly. Lightning emanates
from this <i>flyer</i>, and the thunder is the sound of his voice. This is
the universal belief.</p>

<p>The existence of thunder is a matter of fact, apparent to all
people. It must be explained and accounted for by the savage as
well as by the sage, and by the first with as much confidence as by
the latter, and more; for he who is not supported in his tenets by
reason, must of necessity be confident or fail. He must evince seven
times as much confidence as one who has the support of reason,
which the wise man observed to be the case in his day. The Indian
has no more doubt, apparently, of the correctness of his religious tenets,
than he has that a hungry man wants to eat. He is as confident
of the correctness of his theory, in relation to the thunder, as we
are that it is caused by the passing of electricity from one cloud to
another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>The lightning, which is so terrible in its effects to destroy life, or
to shiver the oak to atoms, is to the Dakota simply the tonwan of a
winged monster, who lives and flies through the heavens shielded by
thick clouds from mortal vision.</p>

<p>By some of the wakan-men, it is said that there are four varieties
of the form of their external manifestation. In essence, however,
they are but one.</p>

<p>One of the varieties is black, with a long beak, and has four joints
in his wing. Another is yellow, without any beak at all, with wings
like the first, only that he has but six quills in each wing. The
third is of scarlet color, and remarkable, chiefly, for having eight
joints in each of its enormous pinions. The fourth is blue and globular
in form, and is destitute both of eyes and ears. Immediately
over where the eyes should be, is a semi-circular line of lightning
resembling an inverted half-moon, from beneath which project downward
two chains of lightning, zigzaging and diverging from each
other as they descend. Two plumes, like soft down, coming out
near the roots of the descending chains of lightning serve for wings.</p>

<p>These thunderers, of course, are of terrific proportions. They
created the wild rice and a variety of prairie grass, the seed of which
bears some resemblance to that of the rice.</p>

<p>At the western extremity of the earth, which is presumed to be
a circular plain surrounded by water, is a high mountain, on the summit
of which is a beautiful mound. On this mound is the palace of
this family of gods. The palace opens towards each of the four cardinal
points, and at each doorway is stationed a watcher. A butterfly
stands at the east entrance, a bear at the west, a reindeer at the
north, and a beaver at the south. Except the head, each of these
wakan sentries is enveloped with scarlet down of the most exquisite
softness and beauty. (Indians are great admirers of scarlet, and to
induce a child to take some nauseous drug, the mother has but to assure
it that it is red.)</p>

<p>The Wakinyan gods are represented as ruthless, cruel and destructive
in their disposition, and ever exert their powers for the
gratification of this, their ruling propensity, at the expense of whatever
may come in their way. They are ever on the “war path,”
and are “sharp shooters.”</p>

<p>Once for all, it may be here stated, that a mortal hatred exists between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the different families of the gods, like that which exists between
Indians of different tribes and languages. The two families
already mentioned, like the Dakota and the Chippewa, are always in
mortal strife. Neither has power to resist the tonwan of the other,
if it strikes him. Their attacks are never open, and neither is safe,
except as he eludes the vigilance of the other. The fossil remains
of the mastodon are confidently believed to be the bones of the Onktehi
which have been killed by the Wakinyan. These relics of the
gods are carefully preserved and held in awful esteem, for their wakan
virtues. The Wakinyan, in his turn, is often surprised and
killed by the Onktehi. Many stories are told of the mortal combats
of these divinities. The writer listened to the relation, by an eye
witness, of a story in substance as follows: “A Wakinyan god
was killed, and fell on the bank of the Blue Earth river, which was
twenty-five or thirty yards between the tips of the wings.”</p>

<p>From the Wakinyan god, the Dakotas have received their war implements,
(spear and tomahawk,) and many of those pigments, which,
if properly applied will shield them from the weapons of their enemies.
Dressed in these pigments, they feel as secure as did the fabled
Greek, protected by the vulcanian shield.</p>

<p>It almost seems as if it were becoming to offer an apology before
proceeding, but it is ventured to presume on the good nature of the
reader and introduce</p>

<h4>THE TAKU SKAN SKAN.</h4>

<p>The signification of the term is, <i>that which stirs</i>. This god is too
subtle in essence to be perceived by the human senses, and is as subtle
in his disposition as in his being. Though invisible, he is ubiquitous.
He is supposed to have a controlling influence over intellect,
instinct and passion. His symbol is the boulder; and, hence, boulders
are universally worshipped by the Dakotas. He lives, also, in
what is termed “the four winds,” and the consecrated spear and tomahawk
are animated by his spirit. He is much gratified to see men
in trouble, and is particularly glad when they die in battle or otherwise.</p>

<p>He can rob a man of the use of his rational faculties, and inspire
a beast with intelligence, so that the hunter, like an idiot, will wander
and become bewildered on the prairie or in the forest, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
game on which he hoped to feast his family at night, escapes with
perfect ease. Or, if he please, he may reverse his influence, and the
animal has not even brutal instinct to escape from its pursuer.</p>

<p>This god is passionate and capricious to the highest degree; and,
hence, it is very difficult to retain his favor. Often he is likened to
a passionate, whimsical child, taking offence at everything, while it
is as necessary to secure his favor, on the part of the hunter or the
warrior, as it is to procure food, or to prove one’s manhood by taking
a scalp. Subordinate to this god are the buzzard, the raven, the
fox, the wolf, and other animals of a similar nature. To him belong
the “armor feast” and the “vapor bath.”</p>

<p>The “armor feast” is of ordinary occurrence when the provisions
are of sufficient abundance to support it, in which the warriors assemble
and exhibit the sacred implements of war, to which they burn
incense around the smoking sacrifice.</p>

<h4>THE HEYOKA.</h4>

<p>This god is so curiously wakan that he is entitled to a brief notice.</p>

<p>Like the Wakinyan, there are four varieties of them, all of which
assume, in substance, the human form, but it would be unnecessarily
tedious to note the differences of form, especially as the differences
are unimportant.</p>

<p>These objects of superstition, are said to be armed with the bow
and arrows, and with the deer-hoof rattle, which things are charged
with electricity. One of the varieties carries a drum, which
is also charged with the same fluid. For a drumstick, he holds a
small Wakinyan god by the tail, striking on the drum with the
beak of the god. This would seem to us to be an unfortunate position
for a god to be in, but it must be remembered that it is wakan,
and the more absurd a thing is the more wakan.</p>

<p>One of these gods, in some respects, answers to the wreathed
zephyr of Grecian mythology. It is the gentle whirlwind which
is sometimes visible in the delicate waving of the tall grass of the
prairie.</p>

<p>By virtue of their medicine and tonwan powers, they render aid
to such men as revere them, in the chase, in inflicting and healing
diseases, and especially in the gratification of their libidinous passions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>That feast, in the observance of which the worshippers dip their
hands into the boiling kettle and lifting the water in their hands,
throw it over each other’s naked bodies with impunity, belongs to this
god.</p>

<p>The nature of the Heyoka is not simply supernatural, it is the
opposite of nature.</p>

<p>He expresses joys by sighs and groans, and by assuming a most
doleful aspect, and sorrow and pain by opposite sounds and aspect.
Heat causes their flesh to shiver, and their teeth to chatter, while
cold makes them perspire and pant. It is said of them, that in the
coldest weather of the Minnesota winter, when mercury congeals, they
seek some prominence on the prairie, where they put up some bushes
to shelter them from the rays of the sun, under which they sit naked
and fan themselves as they swelter with heat, and in the oppressive
heat of summer they fold around them robe on robe, and lean over
a rousing fire, sniveling and shaking with cold like one in a fit of the
ague.</p>

<p>They feel perfect assurance when beset with dangers, and quake
with terror when safe. With them falsehood and truth are reversed,
good is their evil and evil their good.</p>

<p>Years ago at Lac qui-parle, the mother of the tall, “curly-haired
chief,” <span class="smcap">upizahdeya</span>, was informed that it was required of her to make
a feast to the Heyoka. She was so much opposed by some of her
friends that she failed to comply with the wakan mandate, but she
assured her friends, that as a penalty, they would be mortified by
seeing her flesh become black, and her head bald, which came true.
By degrees her flesh did become very dark, and her head bald, but
to an intelligent observer, it was abundantly evident, that instead
of being an infliction of the offended god, it was the result of neglecting
to wash, even her face, for several years, and pulling out her
own hair by little and little.</p>

<h4>THE SUN.</h4>

<p>As the sun is visible to all men, and as it has been an object of
superstitious regard on the part of almost all pagan nations of past
generations, it will not be thought worth while, perhaps, to mention
the fact that the Dakota too, worships the sun. It will not, however,
be quite out of place to put on record a few facts in relation to
this part of Dakota worship, by which they presume to honor this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
glorious object; facts which evince the sentiments of the deluded
worshippers. The following, from the pen of Rev. S. R. Riggs, is
to the point.</p>

<h4>DAKOTA SUN DANCE.</h4>

<p>The Sun is, from many circumstances, a natural object of worship
among the unenlightened nations of men. With the Dakotas, the
sun is sometimes appealed to as a witness. Sometimes they pray
to it, generally with the honorable title of <i>Hunkayapi</i>. Sometimes,
as a god, it communicates with men in dreams and visions. But the
nature of the communication is that the men should dance the <i>wiwanyagwacipi</i>,
with the promise of success in hunting or war. Generally
the object of dancing to the sun is to secure victory over enemies.
In this aspect it is a <i>waihdusna</i> or <i>self-immolation</i> to the sun;
it is an offering up of one’s strength and manhood to secure the aid
of the sun in the day of battle. The Bible says, “the stars in their
courses fought.”</p>

<p>There are occasions, also, when a man dances the sun dance as a
thank-offering. He is sick and apprehends he will die. He makes
a vow that if his life is spared he will dance to the sun. Or, he is
on the war path and he prays to the great <i>hunkayapi</i> for success,
promising in that event to dance to his honor. These are said to
be the occasions and reasons for the <i>Wiwanyag-wacipi</i>.</p>

<p>More than a quarter of a century has passed since I witnessed
this ceremony, and I was there only a couple of hours about the
middle of the day. On the north side a couple of tents, fastened
together, were stretched around poles, forming a large semicircle.
In the focus of the radii stood three dancers, with their eyes turned
towards the sun, which was then in the south. Their faces
and the upper part of their bodies were gaily painted, and their
heads were adorned with feathers. A blue or red blanket was strapped
around their waist, and hung down like a woman’s skirt. Each
one had a fife made of the bone of a swan’s wing, on which they
kept up a toot-toot-toot-ing, varied by the measures of the dance
and the song. Behind them in the shadow of the tent sat the singers
and players on instruments—the drums and rattles. A few women
sat still farther back, who formed a part of the choir, and joined in
the chorus.</p>

<p>The chief dancer on this occasion, if I remember rightly, was <i>Mahipiya<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
sua</i>, who afterwards shot himself. The dancers always make
incisions in their flesh, in which they insert swan’s down or horse
hair. These incisions are commonly made on the shoulders and arms.
When the sacrifice is intended to be as complete as possible, an incision
is made in the back, through which a cord of horse hair is passed,
and a buffalo head is attached to the lower end, so that every time
the body moves up and down, a slight motion is given to the buffalo
head which lies on the ground behind him. At the close, if his
strength remains sufficient, he drags the buffalo head around the
place.</p>

<p>Occasionally a man inflicts still more torture on himself than this.
He makes an incision in his breast, and passing a cord through it he
draws it tight and fastens the other end to a pole which stands immediately
in front of him.</p>

<p>The ceremonies of the sun dance commence in the evening. I
have been under the impression that the time of the full moon was
selected, but I am now informed that it is not essential. The singers
and players on instruments practice their songs in the night, and
there is some dancing. There is also feasting. Before morning the
company generally lie down and sleep awhile.</p>

<p>The real dance commences when the <i>Hunkayapi</i> makes his appearance.
Then the dancers begin and continue without <i>eating</i>, <i>drinking</i>, or
<i>resting</i>, until nature is quite exhausted. Some join in the dance as particular
friends of the dancer. They may occasionally sit down and
smoke, but if the maker of the dance falls down or is observed to be
quite exhausted, a friend may step forward and make a valuable present
to some one. In this case the dancer may rest awhile and begin
again. Some give out entirely before the sun goes down, when the
dance is concluded. Others are able to continue into the night.</p>

<p>A man who dances to the sun is expected to make a song of his
own, which embodies the <i>god-communication</i> to him.</p>

<p>This is sung by the singers when the man is almost dying of thirst.
The brave man pays no attention to it.</p>

<p>The following is from the pen of Major General Curtis, dated
Fort Sully, June 2, 1866:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The whole of the three thousand Sioux camped about us gave me early
information of their design to have the annual sun dance at this time and
place, the season of the year—the trees in full leaf—having now arrived,
and they wished me to inform Colonel Recor, the commander of the soldiers,
that however boisterous their demonstrations might be, they would
all be peaceable and of a pious character.</p>

<p>On yesterday, June 1, the dancing was delayed at intervals to allow tortures
to be inflicted. Two or three men stood over the devotee with needle
and knife, very quietly performing penance, according to the customs of
all these sacerdotal rites, as follows; First, they cut the arms in several
places by striking an awl in the skin, raising it and cutting out about half
an inch; this is done on both arms, and sometimes on the breast and back.
Then wooden setons (sticks about the thickness of a common lead pencil)
are inserted through a hole in the skin and flesh. Then cords or ropes are
attached to these sticks by one end, and to the pole at the other end, the
victim pulling on the ropes till the seton sticks tear out the flesh and skin.
I saw one with two setons thus attached to his breast, pulling till it seemed
to draw the skin out three inches, and finally requiring nearly his whole
might to tear out the seton.</p>

<p>One, painted black, had four ropes attached at once. The pulling
out is done in the dance, the pulling carried on in the time of the music by
jerk, jerk, jerk, and the eye, head, and front all facing the sun in the form
of supplication. One had four setons attached to four dry buffalo head
bones. These were all strung and suspended to his flesh by ropes that
raised each head some three feet off the ground. He danced hard to tear
them out, but they would not break the skin. One came off the stick accidentally,
but it was again fastened. Finally, these heavy weights (each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
at least twenty five pounds weight,) not tearing out by their own weight
or motion, the devotee gave a comrade a horse to take hold of the rope
and tear out the setons. While these were being thus tortured, their female
relations came in and had pieces cut out of their arms to show their
appreciation of the valor and devotion of their kinsmen. Still, as soon as
the victim could be prepared, the music was renewed, and the dismal dance
went on, victims’ bodies now mingled with blood, paint, and setons.</p>

<p>There being several steamboats and many soldiers here, a crowd of spectators
rather embarrassed the performers, so they concluded the performance
at twelve o’clock, having only danced twenty-four hours instead of
forty-eight, as they usually do. All the devotees gave away all their ponies
and other valuables to their friends, had their wounds carefully dressed by
attendant medical men, and sat down to an abundant feast of dog soup
and buffalo meat.</p>

<p>So ended this most barbarous and painful exhibition of savage idolatry.
The picture is still deeply impressed on my senses, but I cannot give half
the horror of the scene, either by pen or pencil.”</p>

</div>

<p>The object of these rites is to obtain the favor of the god to
whom they relate.</p>

<p>In these divinities which have been mentioned, and innumerable
others like them, as various as the wildest imaginations, maddened
by passion, can create, or their circumstances and felt wants demand,
the Dakotas find all that they desire of a religious nature. These
divinities communicate with mortals through the medium of</p>

<h4>THE MEDICINE-MAN.</h4>

<p>These men are the representatives of the gods on earth, to men.
They <i>are</i> the gods in human form, though in diminished proportions.
They are essentially different from other men—wakan.</p>

<p>The original essence of these men and women, for they appear
under both sexes, first wakes into existence floating in ether. As
the winged seed of the thistle, or of the cottonwood, floats on the
air, so they are gently wafted by the “four winds”—“Taku-skan-skan”—through
the regions of space, until, in due time, they find
themselves in the abode of some one of the families of the superior
gods, by whom they are received into intimate fellowship. There
the embryotic medicine-man remains till he becomes familiar with the
characters, abilities, desires, caprices, and employments of the gods.
He becomes essentially assimilated to them, imbibing their spirit, and
becoming acquainted with all the chants, feasts, fasts, dances and
sacrificial rites which it is deemed necessary to impose on men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Some of the more favored of these men are privileged to pass
through a succession of such inspirations, with various families of
the divinities, until they are completely <i>wakanized</i>, and prepared for
human incarnation.</p>

<p>In particular, they are invested with the irresistable powers of
the gods to do good or evil, with their knowledge and cunning, and
their everywhere present influence over mind, instinct and passion.
They are instructed how to inflict diseases and to heal them, to discover
things concealed from common men, to foretell future events, to
manufacture implements of war, and infuse into them the missive
virtue—the tonwan—of the gods, and to perform all sorts of wonders.</p>

<p>Thus qualified for his mission, this germ of wakan, to become incarnate,
is again committed to the direction of the “four winds.”
From his elevated position, he selects a place which is to be the scene
of his service, and enters the body of an unborn infant. Thus he
effects an entrance into the world and into the sympathies of mortals.</p>

<p>When one of them dies, he returns to the abode of his gods, where
he receives a new inspiration and a new commission, to serve a new
generation of men in some other portion of the world. In this
manner he passes through four inspirations and incarnations, and
then returns to his primitive nothingness. These characters, however,
do not always appear in human form, but enter the bodies of
beasts, as the wolf, the bear, and the buffalo.</p>

<p>To establish their claims to inspiration, these characters must, of
course, perform things that are wakan, in a manner to satisfy those
on whom they purpose to impose their superstitions.</p>

<p>For this purpose, they artfully lay hold of all that is strange and
mysterious, and if possible turn it to their own advantage. To do
this is the one object and effort of their lives. It is their study day
and night, at all times and on all occasions. They think about it
when awake, and dream about it when asleep. They make use of
all the means in their power, and their zeal never grows cold.</p>

<p>They assume familiarity with whatever astonishes other people,
with a degree of self complacency, and an air of impudence and
assurance which strikes the observers with amazement. They foretell
future events with a degree of accuracy or of ambiguity which
is sufficient for their purpose. Those at one village affect to be
familiar with what is transpiring at another village leagues distant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
They predict the result of a war expedition as if they had already
been there; and if the prediction is not fulfilled they find no difficulty
in setting the failure to the account of the sins of their followers.</p>

<p>They inflict diseases and heal them. They kill and make alive.
When occasion requires they seem to calm the tempest, or to raise
the storm, and converse with thunder and lightning, as with a familiar
friend and equal. In their devotional exercises, at times, they
wrangle with the gods, charge them with duplicity, and are defiant.
If one of them is killed by the electric fluid, which sometimes happens,
it only proves the truth, to the living, of all he had taught
them concerning the Wakinyan, and that he had provoked their anger
by his sins.</p>

<p>The medicine man is not only familiar with the superior gods who
are out of him, but he also has inferior gods dwelling in him, to satisfy
whose cravings he frequently, and in the most public manner,
tears off with his teeth and eats the raw, quivering, bleeding flesh of
newly-slaughtered animals, like a starving beast or bird of prey, devouring
parts of dogs or fish entire, not excepting bones and scales.</p>

<h4>RAW FISH FEAST.</h4>

<p>In the summer of 1852, a feast of this kind was observed at
Shakopee. It was made by <i>Anoginajin</i>, second chief of the Little
Six band and others.</p>

<p>After two days spent in introductory ceremonies, including “vapor
bath” and “armor-feast,” a tent was prepared opening towards the
east, with a spacious court in front constructed of bushes. Within
the court each of those who were to participate, had a bush set in
which was prepared a nest. Two pikes, each about one foot long,
rouged with vermilion and ornamented with down from the swan,
were placed on some branches of trees in the enclosure. The fishes
were entire as they had been taken from the water. Near the fishes
were placed dishes of birch bark filled with sweetened water. The
implements of war, belonging to the participants, were solemnly exhibited
in the tent. The dancers, who were naked, except the
breech cloth and moccasins, were fantastically smeared with pigments
of various colors, and otherwise ornamented with down, white and
red. Four ranks of chanters and musicians were in attendance.
The dancers claimed to be inspired by the cormorant. They danced
to the music of three ranks of the singers, till their chants closed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
taking little seasons for rest and smoking. When the fourth rank
struck the drum and “<i>lifted up their voices</i>,” the inspiration was poured
out and the welkin trembled, and the dancers approached the
fishes in a rage, like starving beasts, and without using their hands,
tore off piece after piece, scales, bones, entrails and all, and swallowed
them, drinking at the same time from their bark dishes. Nothing
remained at the close except the heads, fins and large bones, which
they had deposited in their nests. To end the ceremony, what few
articles of clothing had been worn on the occasion, were offered in
sacrifice to the gods.</p>

<p>Thus, while the favor of the <span class="smcap">Taku Wakan</span> was secured, the fact
that the dancers were inspired, was demonstrated to most of the six
hundred wondering spectators. By performances of thousands of
wakan things, such as have been hinted at, these men triumphantly
substantiate their claims to inspiration, and they are fully believed
to be “the great powers of the gods,” and, among their people, hold
a position like that of the <span class="smcap">Thugs</span> of India. The wakan qualities
which these persons possess, or assume to possess, qualify them to
act in any capacity and in any emergency.</p>

<h4>THE MEDICINE MAN A PRIEST.</h4>

<p>As a priest, with all the assurance of an eye-witness—of an equal
and of intimate and long continued communion, he bears testimony
for the divinities. He gives a minute description of their physical
appearance, their dwelling place, and their attendants. He reveals
their disposition, their powers and their employments, as one who
has been with them. He dictates prayers and chants, institutes
fasts and feasts, dances and sacrifices. He defines sin and its opposite
and their respective consequences. In short, he imposes upon
the people a system of demonism and superstition, to suit their depraved
tastes and passions, and caprices, and circumstances, and
interests as savages, with an air of authority and with a degree of
cunning which does seem to be almost superhuman—a system so artfully
devised, so well adapted to them, so congenial to them, that it
readily weaves itself into, and becomes a part of them, as really as
the woof becomes a part of the texture, ensuring their most obsequious
submission to its demands. It becomes part of their body, soul
and spirit. They breathe and speak, and sing and live it. It is not
something that can be assumed and laid off at pleasure.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In the character of a priest, the influence of these demons in human
form is so complete and universal, that thirty years ago, scarce
an individual could be found among them who was not a servile
religionist. Every individual was trained to it from early infancy.
Mothers put the consecrated offering into the little unconscious hand
of their babes at the breast, and caused them to cast the present to
the god. As soon as the little tongue could articulate, it was taught
to say, “grandfather befriend me;” or “grandmother befriend me.”
On one occasion the writer witnessed a whole band, old and young,
male and female, march out to the lake shore in Indian file, and perform
their acts of devotion, and offer their prayers at the back of the
medicine man, who was at the same time officiating between them
and the god—each individual was obliged to the performance—the
mothers fixing the little mouths of unconscious infants carefully,
reverently, on the stem of the consecrated pipe, which the priest
extended to them backward over his shoulder.</p>

<p>Much as the savage loves ease and self-indulgence he will cheerfully
subject himself to almost any privation, discomfort and toil, for
days, weeks, or even months together, in order to procure the necessary
provisions for a sacrifice which the priest assures him the gods
demand. If he fails he fully believes that the penalty may be the
infliction of any, or all the evils to which an Indian is exposed. A
man made a trip on foot from the “Little Rapids,” on the Minnesota
river, to Big Stone Lake, and purchased and brought on his back, a
pack of dried buffalo meat, weighing, probably, sixty or seventy
pounds, a distance of nearly two hundred miles, to be used in the
medicine-dance—a sacrifice to the Onktehi and to the souls of the
dead. This he did because the priest had assured him that it was
the will of the <span class="smcap">Taku-Wakan</span>.</p>

<h4>THE WAR PROPHET.</h4>

<p>In this capacity the wakan-man is an indispensable necessity.
Every Dakota man sixteen years old and upward, is a soldier, and is
formally and <i>wakanly</i> enlisted into his service.</p>

<p>From him he receives the implements of war, as the spear and
tomahawk, carefully constructed after a model furnished from the
armory of the gods, painted after the divine prescription and charged
with the missive virtue—the tonwan—of the divinities. From him
also he receives those paints which serve as an armature for the
body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>To obtain these necessary articles from the <span class="smcap">Mde Tahunka</span>—the
War Prophet—the proud applicant is required, for a time, to abuse
himself and serve him, while he goes through a series of painful and
exhausting performances, which are necessary on his part to enlist
the favorable notice of the gods. These performances consist chiefly
of “vapor-baths,” fastings, chants, prayers, and nightly watching.</p>

<p>The spear and tomahawk being prepared and duly consecrated
and rendered wakan, the person who is to receive them, with a most
piteous wail and suppliant aspect, approaches the god-man and reverently
presents to him the pipe of prayer. He then lays his trembling
hand on the head of his master, and sobs out his desires in substance
as follows:</p>

<p>“Pity thou me, poor and helpless—a woman—and confer on me
the ability to perform manly deeds.”</p>

<p>The prophet then, with the majestic mien of a god, places in his
hand the desired weapons, as he says, “Go thou and test the swing
of this tomahawk, and the thrust of this spear; but when in triumph
thou shalt return—a man—forget not thy vows to the gods.”</p>

<p>In this manner every man, it is said, is enlisted into the service of
the war prophet, and enlisted for life.</p>

<p>The weapons thus received, are preserved by the Dakota warrior,
as sacredly as was the “ark of the covenant” by the pious Hebrew
of ancient times. They are carefully wrapped in cloth, together
with sacred pigments, and in fair weather are every day laid outside
of the lodge, and may never be touched by an adult female.</p>

<p>Every warrior feels that his success, both on the battle-field and in
the chase, depends entirely upon the strictness, promptness and constancy
with which he adheres to the rules which are imposed upon
him by the wakan war leader.</p>

<p>The influence of the medicine-man in this capacity, permeates the
whole community, and it is hardly possible to over-estimate it.
Those who are led by him will be murderers, it is their trade. They
are commissioned for this. Those who are bound to these war-prophets,
by such rites, <i>will be led by him unless they renounce their
religion</i>.</p>

<p>The Indian, if he can, will kill a foe, whoever he be, as long as
he is a pagan. He is as apt to do it as a duck is to swim. The favor
of the gods, and even his very manhood, depends upon it. He is
not a man till he has killed a foe. Till their hands have been dipped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
blood they are liable to be abused and insulted in the most outrageous
manner. Young men, in sight of St. Paul, have been obliged to
assume the petticoat and exhibit themselves as women in the public
dance, because they had not killed a foe. The <i>pagan</i> Indian, in a
sense, is obliged to be a murderer.</p>

<h4>THE MEDICINE MAN A DOCTOR.</h4>

<p>The power of the Doctor “caps the climax.” In him all the
powers of the gods meet, as the colors blend in the rain-bow. The
doctor is revered as much, perhaps, as the superior gods themselves.
The subordinate gods dwell in them and confer on them the power
to <i>suck out disease</i> from the human body. If long without practice,
it is said that the gods in them become restless, and subject them to
much inconvenience. To pacify them it is represented that they
sometimes obtain and drink considerable quantities of human blood.</p>

<p>When one of these doctors has been called, with due respect, to
administer relief to a sick person, the patient is placed on a blanket
on the ground, in a lodge vacated for the purpose, with the body
chiefly naked. The doctor also lays off his own clothes, except the
breech cloth. After chants and prayers, the rattling of the sacred
shell, and numerous other noisy ceremonies, with an air and attitude
of self-conceit and impudence, which only a devil could inspire, he
mutters out the following, or something similar: “The gods told
me that having this, I might approach the bones of a dead man even,
and set him on his feet.” He then drops on his knees, at the patient’s
side, and applying his mouth to the part of the body immediately
over what is supposed to be the seat of the disease, he sucks with
frenzy, at the same time rattling the shell with the utmost violence.
In this manner, the god which is in the doctor, draws the disease
from the sufferer. After a considerable time spent in this manner,
like an enraged beast, he suddenly starts to his feet in apparent agony.
He utters dreadful, indescribable sounds, in variety, and groans
which may be distinctly heard for a mile or more, at the same time
violently striking his sides with his hand, and the earth with his feet,
twisting the whole body into the most hideous contortions. He now
grasps a dish of water with his left hand, and proceeds, with a disgusting
sing-song bubbling, with his mouth in the water, to deposit
the disease in the dish, keeping time still with the sacred rattle which
he continues to shake with great energy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>This operation is continued with brief intervals for smoking, for
hours and sometimes day after day and night after night. This
process sometimes effects a cure at once. At other times extra demonstrations
are deemed necessary. The doctor ascertains the sin
which has been committed, and the particular god which has been
offended and inflicted the disease. Then he makes an image of the
offended god, which he hangs on a pole and which is shot by three or
four persons in rapid succession. As the image falls the spirit of the
god which is in the doctor, leaps out, and falling upon the spirit represented
by the image, kills it. On this it is expected that the sick
one will recover. But it is not absolutely certain that even this will
prove effectual. After repeated experiments, the doctor often discovers
that the god who inflicts the disease is mightier than the one
by whom he is inspired, and he desists. Now, unless another doctor
is found, competent to expel the demon, death ensues. The wakan-men
are wakan to a degree corresponding to the strength of the gods
by whom they are respectively inspired.</p>

<p>If the higher doctor can be found, health will be restored, but it is
difficult to obtain their aid. If not duly respected at all times, and
on all occasions, and in all their relations, and well remunerated for
their services, in advance, they may let the patient die without exerting
their powers, or perform their work deceitfully. This seems to
be a necessary provision of their system, as it affords ample room to
account satisfactorily for all failures. This operation is termed
Wapiyapi, or renovation. There are instances where the doctor
prevails on the gods to come in person and perform the operation for
him. The following description of such a scene was obtained from
an Indian who was present on the occasion. The doctor was named
<span class="smcap">Red Bird</span>, of the Lake Calhoun band, who was killed with his son
by the Chippewas in the memorable battle of Rum River, in the
summer of 1839. The sack of Red-Bird, which contains the symbols
of the gods, and which was used on the occasion to which the
narrative relates, has since providentially fallen into the hands of the
writer, and will be herewith forwarded as a relic of superstition worthy
of preservation. The gods employed were the <span class="smcap">Taku-skan-skan</span>:</p>

<p>“A man had been sick a considerable time, and many of the wakan-men
had attempted, to the extent of their ability, to exorcise him,
but without any favorable results. Red-Bird had in his service
many of the gods called Taku-skan-skan. It was decided in council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
that the case should be referred to them. Accordingly, in the evening,
a feast was prepared for the gods, to which they were called
by chants, on the part of the medicine-men. A tent of parchment
was prepared for them. The doctor was bound, by carefully weaving
strings and tying them firmly in all his fingers and toes. Then
his arms were bound behind his back and he rolled up in a buffalo
robe, and carefully bound in it by cords around it outside. He had a
little boulder in his bosom, a symbol of the gods. He charged those
who bound him to do it thoroughly, assuring them that his boys—his
gods—would come and release him. He was so bound that he could
not stir and then was rolled into the tent, and the sick man was
placed by his side. Over him was hung a drum and a deer-hoof rattle;
a large number of spectators were in attendance—men, women,
and children. Red Bird ordered that certain men present should
chant to the gods, which they did. The doctor, in the mean time,
was very demonstrative with his wakan jargon. A young man, who
had been appointed for that purpose, then gave a wild yell, and all
lights were suddenly extinguished. At the instant, a strong wind
struck the tent, and the doctor cried out, as if he were in great fear,
“Boys come carefully, your father is very weak, be careful.” But
the gods did not seem to regard the admonition and beat the drum,
shook the rattle and heaved the tent furiously. The tent seemed to
be full of them and they were very talkative and rude, but their
voices were so fine, so soft, that we could not comprehend their meaning.
They performed the ceremony of exorcising the sick man.
The sounds they made were so different from what we had been
accustomed to hear, and so ludicrous that we could scarcely refrain
from laughter, though we had been forewarned that if any one
should laugh he should be knocked down. The gods called for a pipe
and smoked many pipe’s-full, indicating a large number of them, but
it was dark and they could not be seen. Suddenly the gods were
all gone, and the doctor ordered the torches to be lighted. All expected
to see him still bound, as he was thrust into the tent; but, to
their surprise, he was out of the robe, and all of his fingers and toes
slipped out of their fastenings, though not a single knot had been
untied. The sick man began from that time to recover, though all
sick persons who are treated in this manner do not recover. All
were confirmed in their faith and confidence in the Taku-Wakan.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In some cases the sick are cured by obtaining a new blanket, and
consecrating it to this class of gods, and then wrapping the sick person
in it.</p>

<h4>VAPOR BATH.</h4>

<p>As frequent allusion has been made to this ceremony, and as it is
a rite which is so frequently observed, it seems necessary that it
should be explained. The following description of this rite is furnished
by Rev. S. R. Riggs:</p>

<h4>SIMON’S INIPI.</h4>

<p>“He took <i>eight poles</i> about the size of hoop-poles, of any wood that
would bend readily, and putting the large ends in the ground, at proper
distances in a circle, bent them over and tied them together at the
top. This frame-work he then covered with robes and blankets,
leaving a small hole for a door at one side. It was a little higher
than a man’s head, when seated within. Before the door, he built a
fire, and having selected four round stones (or nearly round) about
as big as a man’s head (size not essential), he placed them in the
fire. He called Wamdiokiya to be high priest on the occasion.
The high priest then ordered him to call so many to be his helpers—the
number determined by the size of the tabernacle—from two to
five. With these he entered into the <i>wokeya</i>, all entirely naked.</p>

<p>Simon stands at the door without, by the fire, to attend the stones.
He has made two paddles about twelve inches long and painted them
red. These are to be used by the man within to move the stones
with. He covers the ground, between the tent door and the fire,
with nice feathers and cut tobacco. When the stones are heated,
the chief within calls to him to roll in the first one. This he does,
with a brand, putting tobacco upon it and praying to it—“Turkan
wahipani mada wo, toka wahte kta wacia.” So he rolls one after
another of the stones over the tobacco and feathers and prays to each
one. The men within receive them and roll them to the middle with
the painted paddles—singing, hi, hi, hi, hi.</p>

<p>They then commence their songs; each one has a song. They all
pray to the <i>Tankan</i> to give Simon help in the day of battle, to make
him strong and furious and successful. The chief then says to his
fellows: “Have mercy on me, I will cool these stones.” And he
proceeds to pour water on them. The steam fills the tent, which has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
been closed entirely after the stones were rolled in. Then they pray
to the <i>Taku skan-skan</i> or to the <i>Wasican</i>. All their gods are called
<i>Wasican</i>.</p>

<p>Simon, this while, stands without crying and praying. The chief
<i>wakan</i> man receives an encouraging communication from the stone
god which he delivers to Simon. When the stones are cold, they all
cry and come out of the booth. So ends this sacrifice to the stone
god.”</p>

<p>The doctors count much on the efficacy of this “vapor bath.”
Perhaps no other one rite is in more general use than this, on the
part of all who wish to become conspicuously <i>wakan</i>.</p>

<p>As regards the medicine man as a doctor, or exorcist, or juggler, it
is not only believed that he can cure diseases, but that he can inflict
them at his pleasure, on any person who may dare to offend him. It
only requires a <i>purpose</i> on his part. They are feared, if possible,
more than the gods themselves, for <i>they are present</i> in the camp and
in the lodge.</p>

<p>If a person is sick, he will give all he possesses and all he can obtain
on credit, to secure the services of one of them, and will cheerfully
give a horse, in advance, for a single performance such as has
been described. In almost innumerable instances, families sacrifice
all that they have on these pretenders, and to be abandoned by them
is felt to be a dire calamity. Parents are as careful to train their
children to respect and revere them, as was an early Puritan to inspire
his children with reverence for the divine institutions of Christendom.
They are respected. They sit in the highest and have the
best of everything. If some among them are thought to be mere
pretenders, this circumstance only serves to enhance the importance
of those who are believed to be true.</p>

<p>Thus, by imposing on an ignorant, savage people, “gods many,”
gods of life and gods of death, gods of hate and revenge and lust,
gods of cold and of heat, gods of all the various passions, gods of
lying, deceit and wrong, gods of gluttony and drunkenness, gods of
lasciviousness and impurity, gods of conception and abortion, gods
innumerable—hideous and horrid monsters, which are the creation
of the inflamed and bedeviled imaginations of these Thugs—these
wakan men—they exert an influence over them, in the various official
capacities which they assume, which is absolute and which pervades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Dakota society—an influence which bears with all its force on
each individual of their victims, which tends to crush him down still
deeper, if indeed there are depths below them, in ignorance, superstition,
degradation and misery of soul and body, and force them into
an unreserved surrender to their own whims and caprices. Of these
wakan men there are from five to twenty five in each of the little
clans of Dakotas.</p>

<p>Alkalies and acids mingled produce effervescence. A like result
attends the contact of any opposing influences. Nothing can exceed
the antagonism that lies between <span class="smcap">truth</span> and the system of superstition
which is the subject of the foregoing paper. Root, trunk,
branches and leaves there is not the smell of truth to be found on it.
It is plainly opposed to truth and truth is opposed to it. It is opposed
by the truth of history, the truth of science, the truth of
“animated nature,” social truth, political truth and spiritual truth.
<i>All</i> truth tends directly to its destruction. A little boy was one day
listening to a missionary who was endeavoring to explain to him the
workings of the magnetic telegraph. The little half naked fellow
seemed to catch an idea of natural truth, and starting up, excitedly
exclaimed. “If that is true, then all our religion is false.” A
glimpse of truth broke the spell that bound his mind, and shook their
whole system of superstition to its foundations. It never recovered
its hold on him. For more than thirty years, truth, in variety, has
been held to the Dakota mind. With a keen and jealous eye, these
wakan men have watched its workings. It has mortified and pained
them to see their cords of error snapped by it, one after another,
and their hold on their blind victims loosened. Their “craft was in
danger.” They have cried with voice and soul, these thirty years,
“Great is the Taku-Wakan—the Taku-Wakan is wakan, and I am
their prophet.”</p>

<p>They have done all they could and dare do, in the circumstances,
to oppose the progress of truth among their people, by slanders and
snares, gibes and abuse, and violence, and even murder. But in
spite of their vigilance and efforts to oppose, truth advanced with
slow but steady step, and worked like “leaven in the meal.” Old
men and young men, old women and young women, boys and girls,
left them, and by open profession of regard for truth, stood boldly up
in the face of their lies. The symbols of the gods, which the priests,
war prophets and doctors had painted, wreathed and paraded “on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
every hill,” were defiantly spurned from their places by the feet of
those who had been used to obey their caprices and crouch to their
authority. The feasts and dances were less fully attended, the medicine-sack
cast away, while hundreds of their former dupes, emancipated,
read daily in their Bibles, sung the song of Zion, and prayed,
in their houses, to their “Father in heaven;” and on the Sabbath
assembled in the Christian church, erected by their own hands, and
seriously, reverently, joined in the holy worship of the God of heaven.
At sight of this, the rage of these demons in human form boiled
over. The effervescence was mighty. Threats were fulminated
and nothing but opportunity was wanting for them to rise, and re-establish
by violence, the waning power of the <span class="smcap">Taku-Wakan</span>, and
to return, wading through the blood of Christians, if need be, to the
homes of their pagan fathers. They hoped to be able to roll back
the providential wheels of the Almighty God.</p>

<p>That opportunity, they deemed, had arrived when all our young
men were being marched off to the South, probably to be swept
away by the great rebellion. Hence, the “out-break” of 1862.
True, it has been said that the <i>Christian</i> Indians were our worst
enemies, but where is the evidence of this? Were not those <i>Christian</i>
Indians, at least by profession, who rescued companies of our
people from death, and conducted them, through perils, to a place of
safety? Which is the exception? Were not those <i>Christian</i> Indians
who, in a considerable number of cases sacrificed their little all
and risked their lives to protect individuals and conduct them to safety?
Were there any exceptions? Which was the <i>pagan</i> Indian who
performed such a deed? Were not those <i>Christian</i> Indians, who, encouraged
by General Sibley, effected the deliverance from bondage
and death, or treatment worse than death, of hundreds of captives
at “Camp Release?” Did not the leaders of that band bear <i>Christian</i>
names, given to them in the holy ordinance of baptism? Who
are they who have composed the band of faithful “scouts,” three
long years standing on our frontiers to protect our citizens from the
scalping-knife of the worshippers of the <i>Taku-wakan</i>, but <i>Christian</i>
Indians? Was there an exception here? It is not claimed for these
Indians that they were <i>model Christians</i>, but they were Christians
by profession, and their names and the names of their wives and
children stood enrolled on the records of the Christian church.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>On the other hand, who led the murderous bands in work of the
destruction? “<i>Little Crow</i>” and his <i>Wakan</i> associates, who, from
old time, had been the open and determined enemies of the Christian
religion, and most zealous and devoted worshippers of the <i>Taku-wakan</i>.
It is not denied that individuals, professing Christians, were
involved in the wrong and fled with the pagans to the plains. We
could name a few such.</p>

<p>Even those of the pagan party who surrendered themselves to our
military authorities, felt that the Wood Lake battle was the result
of the strife between their <i>Medicine-men</i> and “<i>God Almighty</i>;” and from
that day, in their minds, the doom of their gods and of their representatives
was sealed. They soon cast away even the symbols of
their divinities, and a large portion of them began to seek to know
how to worship the God of the Bible.</p>

<p>Those wakan-men will never suffer their people to enter into an
honest treaty of peace with us while they are wakan-men. They
can never be trusted. Circumstances may render them harmless, but
by their own showing, they are <i>essentially wakan</i>. They are devils
incarnate.

exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
